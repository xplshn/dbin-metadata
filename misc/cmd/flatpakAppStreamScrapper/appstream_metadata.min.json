It supports various input formats and can create beautiful presentation slides or export the presentation to various output formats (pictures, pptx, WhatsApp messages and a lot more) so that it can be used for a variety of purposes.\r\n\r\n Cantara has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n \r\nSuper-fast and lightweight: Cantara is less then 10 MB of size and uses the components available on the local operation system as far as possible. It contains no bloatware. It can be run on an old computer, a raspberry-pi and many more. \r\nVery easy to use: Accepts the most common input format (CCLI songselect lyrics file) and creats the presentation slides for an event in only a few seconds. The usage is very intuitive and user-friendly. \r\nGood integration with other presentation software: Cantara can export presentations to the PPTX format and therefore integrates easily with other presentation software like LibreOffice Impress or MS Powerpoint. It can be included in a complex workflow like a church service or even an online streaming event via OBS. In addition, you can export the lyrics to text formats and share them in messenger groups, as a HTML page etc. \r\nMulti-Screen-Support: Multi Screen is supported out of the box. \r\nCustomizable Design and good outlook: The colors and fonts can be configured in the settings. In addition, you can set up a background picture and adjust it’s brightness/transparency. The presentations look beautiful and are easy to read. \r\nMulti language support: Cantara can present and export song presentations in two different languges at the same time. \r\nFree and Open Source: No license fees, no dependence on certain companies–Cantara is licensed under the GPL-3 and can be used everywhere and as you want. \r\nUsed all over the world and continuously developed: Although Cantara is still a quite young project, people from many countries are using it. It has been translated to several langauges. In the future, more functions are going to be implemented. \r\n","version":"2.6.0"},{"app_id":"app.devsuite.Manuals","name":"Manuals","summary":"Read developer documentation","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/app/devsuite/Manuals/b8b09f84c5c4c9094af47fefb443944e/icons/128x128/app.devsuite.Manuals.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/app/devsuite/Manuals/b8b09f84c5c4c9094af47fefb443944e/icons/128x128@2/app.devsuite.Manuals.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/app/devsuite/Manuals/b8b09f84c5c4c9094af47fefb443944e/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/app/devsuite/Manuals/b8b09f84c5c4c9094af47fefb443944e/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/app/devsuite/Manuals/b8b09f84c5c4c9094af47fefb443944e/screenshots/image-3_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/app/devsuite/Manuals/b8b09f84c5c4c9094af47fefb443944e/screenshots/image-4_orig.png"],"categories":"Development","rich_description":"Manuals indexes your developer manuals and provides robust browsing and searching capabilities. \r\n\r\n It supports the devhelp documentation format used by many libraries integrating with the GTK platform.

Additionally, Saber is available across all your devices, large and small, and syncs between them seamlessly. \r\n\r\n Notably, it can invert your notes when you're in dark mode. This allows you to write with white ink on a black background, which is much easier on the eyes in low-light environments like when the teacher turns off the lights in class. Images and PDFs are also inverted, so you can still use a digital printout or a textbook without the fuss. \r\n\r\n Saber uses a dual-password system to protect your notes from anyone but you, even if they have complete control over the server. You can safely store your notes on the official Saber server, another server, or even host your own! \r\n\r\n The app is completely open-source so that anyone can view the source code and see exactly what it's doing and how it handles your data. Many other note-taking apps are closed-source and proprietary, meaning that their inner workings are a mystery to the public. \r\n\r\n As someone who studies maths, highlighting multi-line equations was always a hassle with other apps, where the highlighter would change color when it overlapped with itself. Another problem I had was that in some apps, the highlighter would render on top of the text, fading it out and making it hard to read. Saber's highlighter has no such issues. It utilizes canvas compositing to render the highlighter in a way that is consistent with/better than traditional paper, where it handles overlaps and maintains color consistency. \r\n\r\n Saber has everything you need to keep your notes organized. Create folders inside folders inside folders to your heart's content with no limit on the number of nested folders. And even though a note may be buried deep within a nested folder, you can still access it easily with your most recent notes always available on the home screen. \r\n\r\n Discover a whole new way to capture and organize your thoughts with Saber. Whether you're a student, professional, or creative mind, Saber is your trusted companion for digital handwriting. Download now and let your ideas flow freely!

This is the fastest screen recording tool for Linux. This screen recorder works on X11 and Wayland on AMD, Intel and NVIDIA. \r\n\r\n This screen recorder can be used for recording your desktop offline, for live streaming and for nvidia-like instant replay, where only the last few minutes are saved. \r\n\r\n Supported video codecs:\r\n\r\n \r\nH264 (default) \r\nHEVC (Optionally with HDR) \r\nAV1 (Optionally with HDR. Not currently supported on NVIDIA if you use GPU Screen Recorder flatpak) \r\nVP8 \r\nVP9 \r\n \r\n\r\nSupported audio codecs:\r\n\r\n \r\nOpus (default) \r\nAAC \r\n \r\n\r\n Recording a monitor requires (restricted) root access which means that you have to install GPU Screen Recorder system-wide: \"flatpak install --system com.dec05eba.gpu_screen_recorder\" and pkexec needs to be installed on the system and a polkit agent needs to be running. Note that this only applies to when recording a monitor on AMD/Intel or when recording on Wayland without using the desktop portal option. \r\n\r\n AV1 is currently not supported in the flatpak for Nvidia since GPU Screen Recorder uses an older ffmpeg version to support older Nvidia cards. Install GPU Screen Recorder from source or from AUR if you want to use AV1 on Nvidia.\r\n\r\n Videos are in variable framerate format. Very out of date video players might have an issue playing such videos. It's recommend to use MPV to play such videos, otherwise you might experience stuttering in the video. You can select constant frame rate mode in advanced view if you need it. \r\n\r\n If the video doesn't play or you get green/yellow overlay then your video player is missing H264/HEVC video codec. Either install the video codecs or use mpv. \r\n\r\n AMD has a driver/hardware fault that causes black bars/distorted colors on the sides of the video for certain video resolutions. This happens for both av1 and hevc, so if you have this issue then switch to h264 video codec option in advanced settings. \r\n\r\n If H264/HEVC video encoding option is not available on your AMD/Intel system but you know that your GPU supports those codecs for encoding then you may need to install mesa-extra freedesktop runtime by running this command: \"flatpak install --system org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default//23.08-extra\". \r\n\r\n On NVIDIA systems the flatpak NVIDIA driver needs to match the systems NVIDIA driver version or the NVIDIA driver will fail to properly load in flatpaks. Make sure you update flatpak on your system with: \"flatpak update\", or if that doesn't fix it you can try to install the specific flatpak NVIDIA driver version version that matches your systems NVIDIA driver version by running: \"flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.nvidia-version\", for example \"flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.nvidia-550-54-14\". You can find which NVIDIA driver version is running on your system by running \"cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version\". \r\n\r\n GPU Screen Recorder flatpak can install files in $HOME/.local/share/gpu-screen-recorder. If you want to uninstall GPU Screen Recorder then you will have to remove this directory manually.","version":"4.3.3"},{"app_id":"com.dhsdevelopments.Climaxima","name":"Climaxima","summary":"Frontend for Maxima CAS","screenshots":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokedhs/maxima-client/master/doc/screenshot.png"],"categories":"Science","rich_description":"Climaxima is a user interface building on Maxima.","version":"release-2021-09-23_02"},{"app_id":"com.diffingo.fwbackups.desktop","name":"fwbackups","summary":"A feature-rich, user-friendly backup program","screenshots":["https://diffingo.com/oss/sites/default/files/screenshots/fwbackups/Set-Times.png","https://diffingo.com/oss/sites/default/files/screenshots/fwbackups/OneTime-Settings.png","https://diffingo.com/oss/sites/default/files/screenshots/fwbackups/LogViewer.png","https://diffingo.com/oss/sites/default/files/screenshots/fwbackups/OneTime-Paths.png"],"categories":"Archiving,GTK,Utility","rich_description":"A feature-rich user backup program that allows you to backup your documents on a one-off or recurring scheduled basis.","version":"1.43.8-rc2"},{"app_id":"com.discordapp.Discord","name":"Discord","summary":"Messaging, voice and video client","content_rating":"social-chat:intense,social-info:intense,social-audio:intense,social-contacts:intense,money-purchasing:intense","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/discordapp/Discord/f6ad36464d3bf5acf1e59912fcab8eff/icons/128x128/com.discordapp.Discord.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/discordapp/Discord/f6ad36464d3bf5acf1e59912fcab8eff/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/discordapp/Discord/f6ad36464d3bf5acf1e59912fcab8eff/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/discordapp/Discord/f6ad36464d3bf5acf1e59912fcab8eff/screenshots/image-3_orig.png"],"categories":"InstantMessaging,Network","rich_description":"Discord is a free all in one messaging, voice, and video client thats available on your computer and phone.\r\n\r\n Whether you’re part of a school club, gaming group, worldwide art community, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time together, Discord makes it easy to talk every day and hang out more often.\r\n\r\n \r\nTalk to your friends with messaging, voice, and video in a \"Direct Message\" (1 other person), group chat (up to 10 people), or a multi-channel server (practically infinite maximum members). \r\nDiscord servers are organized into topic-based channels where you can collaborate, share, and just talk about your day without clogging up a group chat. \r\nGrab a seat in a voice channel when you’re free.

However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows. By adding official support for Windows 95, 98, and ME emulation and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games and applications could be enjoyed or used once more. Moreover, DOSBox-X adds support for emulating the NEC PC-98 such that you can also play PC-98 games with it.

The default configurations are in keys.conf and prefs.conf \r\n \r\n\r\nSometimes when reading a document you need to go back a few pages (perhaps to view a definition or something) and quickly jump back to where you were. You can achieve this by using marks. Marks are named locations within a PDF file (each mark has a single character name for example 'a' or 'm') which you can quickly jump to using their name. In the aforementioned example, before going back to the definition you mark your location and later jump back to the mark by invoking its name. Lower case marks are local to the document and upper case marks are global (this should be very familiar to you if you have used vim).\r\n\r\n Suppose you are reading a paragraph which references a figure which is not very close to the current location. Jumping back and forth between the current paragraph and the figure can be very annoying. Using portals, you can link the paragraph's location to the figure's location. Sioyek shows the closest portal destination in a separate window (which is usually placed on a second monitor). This window is automatically updated to show the closest portal destination as the user navigates the document.\r\n\r\n Under Wayland, Sioyek will use by default the Wayland backend, if you prefer the X11 backend you can force it with flatpak run --nosocket=wayland --socket=x11 com.github.ahrm.sioyek\r\n\r\n If you want to theme Sioyek, the prefs_user.config file will be looked up in ~/.config/sioyek/","version":"2.0.0.fl1"},{"app_id":"com.github.alainm23.byte","name":"Byte","summary":"Rediscover your music","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/alainm23.byte/e362ec4fbdd49ffdae1d02b4157a7bba/icons/128x128/com.github.alainm23.byte.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/alainm23.byte/e362ec4fbdd49ffdae1d02b4157a7bba/icons/128x128@2/com.github.alainm23.byte.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/alainm23.byte/e362ec4fbdd49ffdae1d02b4157a7bba/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/alainm23.byte/e362ec4fbdd49ffdae1d02b4157a7bba/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"],"categories":"Audio,Music,Player,AudioVideo","rich_description":"Interact with your music and fall in love with your library all over again.\r\n\r\n Byte offers a beautiful presentation of your Music Library with loads of powerful features in a minimalistic yet highly customizable UI.\r\n\r\n Handy features:\r\n\r\n \r\nLight and Dark themes. \r\nAdd up to 100 items under \"Recently Added\" for songs. \r\nSort individual playlists by album, title, play count or recently added. \r\nAdvanced Media Details and Artist Info. \r\nGroup Playlists, Albums, Artists, Songs, etc. \r\nSearch, add and play your favorite online radio stations. \r\n","version":"0.4.2"},{"app_id":"com.github.alecaddd.sequeler","name":"Sequeler","summary":"Friendly SQL Client","content_rating":"violence-cartoon:none,violence-fantasy:none,violence-realistic:none,violence-bloodshed:none,violence-sexual:none,violence-desecration:none,violence-slavery:none,violence-worship:none,drugs-alcohol:none,drugs-narcotics:none,drugs-tobacco:none,sex-nudity:none,sex-themes:none,sex-homosexuality:none,sex-prostitution:none,sex-adultery:none,sex-appearance:none,language-profanity:none,language-humor:none,language-discrimination:none,social-chat:none,social-info:none,social-audio:none,social-location:none,social-contacts:none,money-purchasing:none,money-gambling:none","screenshots":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alecaddd/sequeler/master/data/assets/screenshots/sequeler-screenshot.png","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alecaddd/sequeler/master/data/assets/screenshots/sequeler-screenshot1.png","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alecaddd/sequeler/master/data/assets/screenshots/sequeler-screenshot2.png"],"categories":"Development,Utility","rich_description":"Easily connect to your local or remote database\r\n\r\nStore your Database Connections in the library, connect over SSH tunnel, type and execute SQL commands directly in the app, and do everything you need to do without the necessity of opening the terminal.\r\n\r\nSupported Databases:\r\n\r\n\r\nSQLite\r\nMySQL\r\nMariaDB\r\nPostgreSQL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Application Features List Include:\r\n\r\n\r\nTest Connections before saving them\r\nView Table structure, content, and relations\r\nWrite multiple custom SQL Queries\r\nSwitch between light and dark mode\r\nHandy keyboard shortcuts to quit (ctrl+q), create new connection (ctrl+shift+n), open a new window (ctrl+n)\r\n","version":"0.8.2"},{"app_id":"com.github.alexhuntley.Plots","name":"Plots","summary":"Simple graph plotting","screenshots":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexhuntley/Plots/main/res/screenshot_fourier.png","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexhuntley/Plots/main/res/screenshot_polar_implicit.png","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexhuntley/Plots/main/res/screenshot_dark_sliders.png"],"categories":"Education,Math,Science","rich_description":"Plots makes it easy to visualise mathematical formulae.

As the Xilinx tools are not redistributable, this package does not contain any Xilinx-licensed material, which is instead downloaded on-the-fly through the official Xilinx installer. To install it, install the flatpak package, then run any Xilinx launcher and follow the instructions. To uninstall, just remove the flatpak package to remove this wrapper. Note that this does not remove the Xilinx installation; to remove it, run the launcher \"Uninstall Xilinx Design Tools or Devices\" (or run \"flatpak uninstall com.github.corna.Vivado --delete-data\" to wipe everything in in \"~/.var/app/com.github.corna.Vivado/\").\r\n\r\n Why can't I see some of my files in Vivado? - All the Xilinx tools handled by this wrapper run in a sandbox with limited filesystem access, only your downloads, documents and desktop folders are visibile.

Barrier does this in software, allowing you to tell it which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen, or by using a keypress to switch focus to a different system.\r\n\r\n Barrier was forked from Symless's Synergy 1.9 codebase. Synergy was a commercialized reimplementation of the original CosmoSynergy written by Chris Schoeneman.\r\n\r\n What's different?\r\n\r\n Whereas Synergy has moved beyond its goals from the 1.x era, Barrier aims to maintain that simplicity. Barrier will let you use your keyboard and mouse from machine A to control machine B (or more). It's that simple.\r\n\r\n Project goals\r\n\r\n Hassle-free reliability. We are users, too. Barrier was created so that we could solve the issues we had with synergy and then share these fixes with other users.\r\n\r\n Compatibility. We use more than one operating system and you probably do, too. Windows, OSX, Linux, FreeBSD... Barrier should \"just work\". We will also have our eye on Wayland when the time comes.\r\n\r\n Communication. Everything we do is in the open.

Using natural language and drawing on ideas from linguistics and from literate programming, Inform is widely used as a medium for literary writing, as a prototyping tool in the games industry, and in education, both at school and university level (where Inform is often assigned material for courses on digital narrative).\r\n\r\nThe Inform project was created by Graham Nelson in 1993 and first came to the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop in 1995, and is now available as an app. It combines the core Inform software with full documentation, including two books and nearly 500 fully working examples. Connecting to the Inform website, it can automatically download and update extensions from a fully curated Public Library used by the world-wide Inform community. The app offers richly detailed indexing of projects and scales from tiny fictions like \"Kate is a woman in the Research Lab\" right up to enormous imaginary worlds whose source text runs to over 3 million words. Features for automated testing, packaging and releasing round out a fully-featured development environment for IF.\r\n\r\nInform is free, with no strings attached. What you make with it is yours, to publish on your website, sell, or give to your friends. There's a vibrant community of users who welcome newcomers (and the app will help you find a high-traffic forum for discussions). Lastly, Inform is continuously maintained and developed. All bug reports are examined and acted on (and the app will show you how to post them).\r\n\r\nThe source code behind the Inform 7 design system itself is linked here: https://github.com/ganelson/inform/\r\n\r\nThe source code behind this IDE is linked here: https://github.com/ptomato/inform7-ide/","version":"2.0.0"},{"app_id":"com.inklestudios.Inky","name":"Inky","summary":"Write interactive narrative in inkle's markup language","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/inklestudios/Inky/5a51bfd601c3acca86cd1f228ede35a7/icons/128x128/com.inklestudios.Inky.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/inklestudios/Inky/5a51bfd601c3acca86cd1f228ede35a7/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"],"categories":"Development,IDE","rich_description":"Inky is a editor for ink, inkle's markup language for writing interactive narrative in games, as used in 80 Days.\r\n\r\n It's an IDE (integrated development environment), because it gives you a single app that lets you play in the editor as you write, and fix any bugs in your code.","version":"0.15.1"},{"app_id":"com.inochi2d.inochi-creator","name":"Inochi Creator","summary":"Tool to create and edit Inochi2D puppets","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/inochi2d/inochi-creator/301e8b935cd389f1e90aeac8148c28ec/icons/128x128/com.inochi2d.inochi-creator.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/inochi2d/inochi-creator/301e8b935cd389f1e90aeac8148c28ec/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"],"categories":"Graphics","rich_description":"Inochi2D is a framework for realtime 2D puppet animation which can be used for VTubing, game development and digital animation.\r\n\r\n Inochi Creator is a tool that lets you create and edit Inochi2D puppets.","version":"0.8.6"},{"app_id":"com.inochi2d.inochi-session","name":"Inochi Session","summary":"Stream with Inochi2D puppets","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/inochi2d/inochi-session/f2bbaddd89a727e60415340d15c2047c/icons/128x128/com.inochi2d.inochi-session.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/inochi2d/inochi-session/f2bbaddd89a727e60415340d15c2047c/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"],"categories":"Graphics","rich_description":"Inochi2D is a framework for realtime 2D puppet animation which can be used for VTubing, game development and digital animation.\r\n\r\n Inochi Session is a tool that lets you use your Inochi2D models for live streaming.","version":"0.8.7"},{"app_id":"com.interversehq.qView","name":"qView","summary":"Practical and minimal image viewer","screenshots":["https://interversehq.com/qview/assets/img/screenshot1.png","https://interversehq.com/qview/assets/img/screenshot2.png","https://interversehq.com/qview/assets/img/screenshot3.png"],"categories":"Graphics,Photography,Viewer","rich_description":"qView is a Qt image viewer designed with minimalism and usability in mind.

Keep passwords in a secure vault, access when and where you need them.\r\n\r\n NordPass is designed by the same team that created a leading VPN service, now trusted by more than 12 million users - NordVPN. Therefore, security and simplicity are the top NordPass priorities.\r\n\r\n With NordPass, store your passwords and secure notes all in one place, access them on any device, and share them with people you trust. Your passwords are protected by the latest encryption algorithm, XChaCha20, and zero-knowledge architecture. Your passwords are yours to have - we know nothing.\r\n\r\n What does NordPass do?\r\n\r\n \r\nAutosave. Forget saving your passwords manually. With NordPass, you can add them to your vault in a few simple clicks. \r\nAutofill. Scrolling through a database of logins and passwords isn’t for you? That’s what autofill is for. Let NordPass do the work. \r\nPassword generator. Unique passwords are essential for truly secure accounts. With NordPass, you can generate them in a matter of seconds. \r\nPassword strength checker. Using a password manager enhances your security, but it won’t help you if your passwords are easy to crack. Check how strong your passwords are before you use them on any accounts. \r\nSecure password sharing. We get it: sometimes, you need to share your passwords. If you do, you might as well share them safely with a secure password sharing feature. \r\nSecure all that matters. NordPass isn’t just for passwords.

But the Nazis, refusing to capitulate, have grown obsessed with human experiments and occult artifacts, in which they see a potential escape from their final Doom. The Allied leaders reject this possibility as nonsense; nonetheless, some still fear what the Führer might be up to. The situation is nebulous, however, and little is certain.\r\n\r\nYou are Cpt. William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, an Allied spy, a fearless risk-taker, and the greatest soldier to ever take up arms in World War II. Your role has changed, though; you've retired from active duty, and now you spearhead operations as a systems analyst. You thought it would be the right choice--leading and motivating instead of doing the dirty work--but lately you've grown restless. At least until a few days ago, when you received an encrypted message from your old friend and comrade Cpt. Douglas Blake, calling you back to duty...\r\n\r\nFEATURES Blade of Agony is much more than just a pastiche of the classic shooters that inspired it; the project will offer a unique experience. It also has many features not often seen in source port projects--Blade of Agony truly pushes GZDoom to its limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n36 playable and unique levels\r\nOrchestra-quality game music\r\nVoice acting and ambient soundscapes\r\nA combination of low-poly models and hi-resolution sprite assets to create the perfect retro feeling\r\nDevastating armaments from the battlefields of WWII\r\nInteractive NPCs that support the twisted plot's progress and help you understand the game\r\nBeautiful special effects (weather, elements, explosions, etc.)\r\nAchievements system similar to those seen on Steam\r\nLauncher which supports external addons\r\nMuch, much more!\r\n","version":"3.1"},{"app_id":"com.redis.RedisInsight","name":"Redis Insight","summary":"Developer GUI for Redis, by Redis","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/redis/RedisInsight/58f6cd055705d3da6818e4752651156a/icons/128x128/com.redis.RedisInsight.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/redis/RedisInsight/58f6cd055705d3da6818e4752651156a/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/redis/RedisInsight/58f6cd055705d3da6818e4752651156a/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/redis/RedisInsight/58f6cd055705d3da6818e4752651156a/screenshots/image-3_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/redis/RedisInsight/58f6cd055705d3da6818e4752651156a/screenshots/image-4_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/redis/RedisInsight/58f6cd055705d3da6818e4752651156a/screenshots/image-5_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/redis/RedisInsight/58f6cd055705d3da6818e4752651156a/screenshots/image-6_orig.png"],"categories":"Development","rich_description":"RedisInsight is an intuitive and efficient GUI for Redis, allowing you to interact with your databases and manage your data—with built-in support for Redis modules.\r\n\r\n RedisInsight Highlights: \r\n\r\n \r\nBrowse, filter, visualise your key-value Redis data structures and see key values in different formats (including JSON, Hex, ASCII, etc.) \r\nCRUD support for lists, hashes, strings, sets, sorted sets, and streams \r\nCRUD support for [JSON](https://redis.io/json/) data structure \r\nInteractive tutorials to learn easily, among other things, how to leverage the native JSON data structure supporting structured querying and full-text search, including vector similarity search for your AI use cases \r\nContextualised recommendations to optimize performance and memory usage.

Your goal is to survive in the environment, adapt your species by adding mutations, and thrive. Other species will emerge to compete with yours. They will evolve via a population dynamics driven simulation with random mutations - you must improve and spread your species to surpass them. The success of your species depends both on your skill in surviving as an individual cell and the changes you make in the editor. \r\n\r\n In the Microbe Stage, you control a single microbe or a colony of microbes bound together. You swim through a watery environment to find the resources your cell needs to stay alive and to reproduce. Once you have reproduced, you enter the editor, where you can review how well your species and others are surviving, move to new biomes, and modify your species. Add new organelles, change your membrane, and change your cell's visuals. Your goal is to become a more complex lifeform by first evolving the nucleus to become a eukaryote, then using binding agents to form cell colonies, the precursor to the first multicellular lifeforms. \r\n\r\n Current key features:\r\n\r\n \r\n Control an individual member of your species and survive the environment \r\n Predate on other species, use photosynsthesis or scavenge for resources \r\n Edit your species to make it more successful \r\n Compete with other species emerging on your planet via an evolution simulation \r\n Explore different biomes \r\n Fight other cells with multiple cellular level weapons \r\n Try different gameplay styles by specializing in different energy sources in subsequent playthroughs \r\n Learn about biology by using real compounds, organelles or parts inspired by real science \r\n Spread your species via the biome map \r\n Review and plan future actions by looking at population simulation results and graphs \r\n Learn the basics of the game with a light interactive tutorial \r\n \r\n\r\n The major goals of Thrive are to create engaging, compelling gameplay that respects our players’ intelligence, and remain as accurate as possible in our depiction of known scientific theory without compromising the former. Thrive is an open-source project, and anyone with game development skill is welcome to join our team. The game uses the open-source Godot engine with the C# programming language. \r\n\r\n If you don't have game development skills, you are still welcome to join our fan community.

The player is also responsible for catching spies in their own kingdom. Inns built within the game allow players to hire mercenaries of various occupations, skill levels, and races.

It began as a project to improve on the original game's quirks, but has since evolved into a separate game, with many unique features.\r\n\r\n Shattered Pixel Dungeon includes:\r\n\r\n \r\nHigh replayability: Randomly generated levels, enemies, and items. No two games are the same! \r\n4 hero classes: Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Huntress. Each hero has a unique playstyle. \r\n8 subclasses: Successful heroes can refine their skills to become more powerful. \r\n5 distinct dungeon regions: each with their own enemies, traps, and quests. \r\nOver 150 different items: including powerful wands, rings, weapons, and armor. \r\n50+ different enemies, 30 different traps, and 5 bosses to test your skills. \r\nUnique artifacts, which grow in power as you use them. \r\nUpdates, with new content roughly once a month. \r\n \r\n\r\nShattered Pixel Dungeon is a 100% free game. There are no advertisements, microtransactions, or paywalls. An optional donation to support the game unlocks a couple of fun extras, but these are entirely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay.\r\n\r\n Find an issue with the game? Have a suggestion?

Publish, not perish.\r\n\r\n In modern times, getting a hold of the flood of information is almost as hard as inserting a USB drive the right way on the first attempt. Zettlr allows you to connect pieces of information using state of the art Zettelkasten methodology. Links? Check. File IDs? Check. File tagging? Also check. And the best is: Unlike many competitors, Zettlr never locks you in. Zettlr supports almost every conceivable way to create links and identify your files. In other words: No matter where you come from — all Zettelkästen are beautiful and supported by Zettlr. Out of the box.\r\n\r\n Zettlr integrates well with reference managers such as Zotero, JabRef, or Juris-M. Simply load your library into Zettlr, and begin to cite. Zettlr strictly adheres to established standards and does not reinvent the wheel. Citations can be loaded using CSL-JSON or BibTex and the citation processor only uses Citation Style Language, the de-facto industry standard for citations. This enables you to use one of over 9,000 different styles from the official Zotero repository!\r\n\r\n Due to its designing flexibility, Zettlr supports dark mode out of the box, as well as many different themes, suited to your needs. Switching is as easy as pressing a button. Not satisfied with the provided themes? No problem: Zettlr allows full customization of every single element; you can even create completely new themes using Custom CSS!\r\n\r\n No matter whether you work with a lot of notes, such as a Zettelkasten, or simply have a lot of files with different important contents: Zettlr's revolutionary heatmap search lets you find every single note you've ever written. No more confusion over where that one citation was!\r\n\r\n Twitter invented them and, since then, everybody adopted them: Hashtags! Zettlr goes one step further, not only allowing you to link and categorize your notes using tags, but using its tag-manager you can assign colors to tags to visualize your notes immediately!\r\n\r\n Zettlr scales well with your aspirations.

Humans are nothing more than cattle, fed on by more powerful entities and hunted down for sport. Humans in general are weak, not even a match for the children of those who hunt them, and they know it. The human race is steadily declining, and before long, mankind will exist no longer.\r\n\r\n As a child born into such a world, Max aspires to become a hero. A mighty warrior who will save the human race from the cusp of extinction, wielding strength unheard of for a boy on the brink of adulthood. He is already the strongest fighter in his village in hand to hand combat, and he has killed his fair share of low-level monsters. At seventeen years of age, he is well on his way to becoming the hero he aspires to be, and no matter how much his fellow villagers hate and scorn him for his demonic aura, Max wishes to save every one of them.\r\n\r\n Forever by Max's side is his childhood friend and love interest, Celeste. Like Max, she possesses incredible strength, and is by far the strongest sorceress in the village. She is knowledgeable, intelligent, well-liked, and quite attractive; a truly fortunate young woman in almost every way imaginable. However, beneath this amiable exterior is a mind far more cynical and unforgiving. She does not share Max's outlook on life, nor does she condone his desire to become a hero, or to protect those who harm him. To her, humans are no better than the demons oppressing them, and she would happily leave their village in flames, if only Max would go with her.\r\n\r\n As Max and Celeste go about their routine lives in the small village they call home, their differing views on the world clash every day, with each one trying to convince the other to see the light. But with the other villagers all living in fear and contempt of Max, and not hesitating for a moment to show how they feel, Celeste has a clear advantage. She believes it's only a matter of time before Max realizes what a fool he has been, and with the level of malice being directed towards Max increasing day by day, she might be right.\r\n\r\n Will Max manage to convince Celeste that the human race is worth protecting?

He believed that if he ran far enough, and for long enough, he could leave it all behind. A normal life would finally be his, and he would be able to spend his days peacefully, helping others and protecting their happiness, rather than destroying them without mercy.\r\n\r\n But as Kouichirou knew deep inside his heart, peace would not be his so easily.\r\n\r\n After weeks on the run, Kouichirou passed through Hotsu Village, and the moment he did, he spelled its demise. The Kodokushi, an elite band of samurai he used to lead, slaughtered the village's residents, then set it ablaze and continued their search.\r\n\r\n Powerless to stop them, Kouichirou emerged after his former subordinates moved on, desperate to put out the flames and find himself food and shelter. He moved from house to house, searching for anything edible, until he at last stumbled upon a storeroom, in which he found... a girl.\r\n\r\n Orphaned, maimed, and robbed of her village, the girl would undoubtedly die a slow, painful death.

In fixed mode, if the android device screen resolution fits into your PC screen, the android device display is centered and mapped on the host at a 1:1 ratio.

It should warn that the link with the PC is not yet established. For the link to be fully establish, you need to start the virtual-pen app on your PC which will set your device in accessory mode. On the linux host, launch the Virtual Pen application, select your device (hit refresh if not shown) then enter the device's screen horizontal and vertical resolutions and then press \"connect\".

This is especially inefficient when the sections are far apart. \r\n\r\n Jumpdf solves this by having multiple marks/cursors one can switch between. Instead of scrolling, one can create a new mark at the desired location and jump back and forth. In addition, the marks are grouped into groups, which one can also switch between, enabling one to maintain different sets of related marks. For example, in a textbook, one can have a group with marks for the exercises and solutions and another group for reading the material relevant to the exercises. Having these groups also enables one to have a separate window for each group. \r\n\r\n Existing PDF viewers like sioyek and zathura also have marks. However, their marks only record locations, whereas in jumpdf, the current mark follows the current cursor, functioning more like tabs. This allows for maintaining multiple views of the document without having to manually reset the marks. \r\n\r\n For more information and to fully use the features, see the GitHub page linked under the \"Links\" tab near the bottom.

Until Open Cloud Save is more battle tested, we will issue a warning for users to use caution with “critical, beloved” save data.\r\n\r\nOpen Cloud Save gives an advantage over existing cloud solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Allows cloud saves for games without developer support 2. Allows for the exclusion of certain files or filetypes.

Allows for sync between storefronts - you own a Steam on linux and a Epic Game Store version on windows\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n1. Inclusion of specific save files based on [pattern matching](https://rclone.org/filtering/) 2. Customizable save data locations - you can tailor the app to your specific save locations 3. Ability to create new save definitions - you do not need to wait for developers to support cloud saves for their games. 4.

is a modern port of the Descent game engine, based on the late D1X and D2X source ports (which, in turn, were based on the original Descent source release and LDescent). The Rebirth Team has spent a lot of time working to improve the source code by fixing old bugs and adding some improvements, while always staying true to our philosophy: Keep it Descent! \r\n\r\n DXX-Rebirth has every little feature you may remember from the original Descent 1 & 2 and much more. For example:\r\n\r\n \r\nFull compatibility with Descent and Descent 2, including all expansions and third-party levels. \r\nDXX-Rebirth runs on your favourite Operating System. We officially support Linux (and other *NIXs), Mac OS X and Windows. The source code can also be compiled on many other systems! \r\nOpenGL provides fast and smooth rendering - even on low-end systems. \r\nOptionally you can enable several effects like Transparency, Colored Lighting, Texture Filtering, FSAA, etc. \r\nThanks to SDL, a wide variety of Joysticks are supported. Also you can use more Joysticks, buttons and axes than you can ever operate in your state of evolution. \r\nJoystick, Keyboard and Mouse can be used simultaneously. \r\nThe games can display all resolutions and aspects supported by your monitor, including an option for VSync. \r\nBesides MIDI and CD-Audio (Redbook), you can play your own custom Music from your hard drive or a separate AddOn. \r\nBoth games can utilize special AddOn packs to replace or expand the original game content. \r\nMultiplayer via UDP protocol provides a fast and easy-to-use LAN and Online action. This includes reliable communication causing less glitches due to lost packets. \r\nThe ingame Demo-recording system has been improved. Demos are less glitchy and smaller while still still being backwards-compatible to earlier versions of the games. \r\nHigher game speed will not cause glitches such as unacceptable fast homing projectiles, incredible high damage caused by several collisions or Fusion cannon, etc. \r\nPlayer files, Savegames, Demos and Missions from DOS-Versions of the games can freely be used in DXX-Rebirth and vice versa. \r\nMac Command keys are now working - see F1 Help. Command-Q works much like a normal Mac program \r\nMultiplayer support over UDP/IP (using port 42424 by default) \r\nEven more ... \r\n","version":"0.60.0-beta2"},{"app_id":"io.github.dyegoaurelio.simple-wireplumber-gui","name":"Simple Wireplumber GUI","summary":"A simple GTK4 GUI for PipeWire","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/dyegoaurelio.simple-wireplumber-gui/92236329b130c5455a189b5fa4d1fb4e/icons/128x128/io.github.dyegoaurelio.simple-wireplumber-gui.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/dyegoaurelio.simple-wireplumber-gui/92236329b130c5455a189b5fa4d1fb4e/icons/128x128@2/io.github.dyegoaurelio.simple-wireplumber-gui.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/dyegoaurelio.simple-wireplumber-gui/92236329b130c5455a189b5fa4d1fb4e/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"],"categories":"AudioVideo,Audio,Utility","rich_description":"Simple Wireplumber GUI","version":"0.1.4"},{"app_id":"io.github.dzheremi2.lrcmake-gtk","name":"LRCMake","summary":"Sync lyrics of your loved songs","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/dzheremi2.lrcmake-gtk/b17d3173eb8d3319fae47c20139b7756/icons/128x128/io.github.dzheremi2.lrcmake-gtk.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/dzheremi2.lrcmake-gtk/b17d3173eb8d3319fae47c20139b7756/icons/128x128@2/io.github.dzheremi2.lrcmake-gtk.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/dzheremi2.lrcmake-gtk/b17d3173eb8d3319fae47c20139b7756/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/dzheremi2.lrcmake-gtk/b17d3173eb8d3319fae47c20139b7756/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/dzheremi2.lrcmake-gtk/b17d3173eb8d3319fae47c20139b7756/screenshots/image-3_orig.png"],"categories":"Utility","rich_description":"This app helps you to contribute to the large database of synced lyrics with beautiful GTK4 and LibAdwaita interface.","version":"0.1.2"},{"app_id":"io.github.ec_.Quake3e.OpenArena","name":"OpenArena","summary":"Free and open source first-person shooter","content_rating":"violence-fantasy:moderate,violence-bloodshed:mild,language-profanity:mild,social-chat:intense","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/ec_.Quake3e.OpenArena/b8c383c49610357fcf7394a809128f74/icons/128x128/io.github.ec_.Quake3e.OpenArena.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/ec_.Quake3e.OpenArena/b8c383c49610357fcf7394a809128f74/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/ec_.Quake3e.OpenArena/b8c383c49610357fcf7394a809128f74/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/ec_.Quake3e.OpenArena/b8c383c49610357fcf7394a809128f74/screenshots/image-3_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/ec_.Quake3e.OpenArena/b8c383c49610357fcf7394a809128f74/screenshots/image-4_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/ec_.Quake3e.OpenArena/b8c383c49610357fcf7394a809128f74/screenshots/image-5_orig.png"],"categories":"Game,ActionGame","rich_description":"OpenArena is a free and open source first-person shooter game based heavily on the Quake III Arena-style deathmatch.

It aims at finding citations of the Septuagint in the Greek New Testament in a mechanical way. \r\n\r\n The Bible, a book that has been translated into many languages, is maybe the most important book has ever existed. Believers have evidence that it is God's word, written by various people being inspired by God himself. \r\n\r\n The Bible has many internal references. Many of them connect the two parts of the Bible: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The books of the Old Testament are usually written in Hebrew, while the books of the New Testament are Greek. A natural question can arise: How can Hebrew texts be cited in the Greek text? \r\n\r\n There are several research projects on this, and today it seems to be clear that many authors of the New Testament cited a Greek translation of the Hebrew text, namely the Septuagint, that was widely popular in the first centuries, and still popular in some Christian churches. Many Bible translations, however, mostly use only the Hebrew text as a basis of the Old Testament, because the importance of the Septuagint is not yet widely identified. \r\n\r\n This software project attempts to support finding citations of the Septuagint in the New Testament automatically. The work is based on The SWORD Project. \r\n\r\n The bibref package offers several tools that help in comparing the verses of the Septuagint with the verses of the Greek New Testament. The tools consider the texts of full books of the Bible as one unit instead of considering just separated verses. The texts are provided by the SWORD project from the modules LXX and SBLGNT. In the newest versions the module StatResGNT is also supported.

Pd-L2Ork is a brainchild of the Virginia Tech Linux Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork). \r\n\r\n Pure Data is an open source visual programming environment that runs on anything from personal computers to embedded devices (ie Raspberry Pi) and smartphones (via libpd, DroidParty (Android), and PdParty (iOS). It is a major branch of the family of patcher programming languages known as Max (Max/FTS, ISPW Max, Max/MSP, etc), originally developed by Miller Puckette at IRCAM. \r\n\r\n Pd enables musicians, visual artists, performers, researchers, and developers to create software graphically without writing lines of code. Pd can be used to process and generate sound, video, 2D/3D graphics, and interface sensors, input devices, and MIDI. Pd can easily work over local and remote networks to integrate wearable technology, motor systems, lighting rigs, and other equipment. It is suitable for learning basic multimedia processing and visual programming methods as well as for realizing complex systems for large-scale projects.

It is designed to be the go-to tool for encryption, with a focus on security, simplicity, and reliability. Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security, even from three-letter agencies like the NSA. Your privacy and security is under attack. Take it back with confidence by protecting your files with Picocrypt. For more info, please visit the project's GitHub repository. \r\n\r\n A list of features:\r\n\r\n \r\nPassword generator: Picocrypt provides a secure password generator that you can use to create cryptographically secure passwords. You can customize the password length, as well as the types of characters to include. \r\nComments: Use this to store notes, information, and text along with the file (it won't be encrypted). For example, you can put a description of the file you're encrypting before sending it to someone. When the person you sent it to drops the file into Picocrypt, your description will be shown to that person. Comments are not authenticated, meaning it can be freely modified by an attacker. Thus, it should only be used for informational purposes in trusted environments. \r\nKeyfiles: Picocrypt supports the use of keyfiles as an additional form of authentication (or the only form of authentication). It also provides a secure built-in keyfile generator. \r\nParanoid mode: Using this mode will encrypt your data with both XChaCha20 and Serpent in a cascade fashion, and use HMAC-SHA3 to authenticate data instead of BLAKE2b. Argon2 parameters will be increased significantly as well. \r\nReed-Solomon: This feature is very useful if you are planning to archive important data on a cloud provider or external medium for a long time. If checked, Picocrypt will use the Reed-Solomon error correction code to add 8 extra bytes for every 128 bytes of data to prevent file corruption. This means that up to ~3% of your file can corrupt and Picocrypt will still be able to correct the errors and decrypt your files with no corruption. \r\nForce decrypt: Picocrypt automatically checks for file integrity upon decryption. If the file has been modified or is corrupted, Picocrypt will automatically delete the output for the user's safety. If you would like to override these safeguards, check this option. Also, if this option is checked and the Reed-Solomon feature was used on the encrypted volume, Picocrypt will attempt to recover as much of the file as possible during decryption. \r\nSplit into chunks: With Picocrypt, you can choose to split your output file into custom-sized chunks, so large files can become more manageable and easier to upload to cloud providers. Simply choose a unit (KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB) and enter your desired chunk size for that unit. To decrypt the chunks, simply drag one of them into Picocrypt and the chunks will be automatically recombined during decryption. \r\nCompress files: By default, Picocrypt uses a zip file with no compression to quickly merge files together when encrypting multiple files. If you would like to compress these files, however, simply check this box and the standard Deflate compression algorithm will be applied during encryption. \r\nDeniability: Picocrypt volumes typically follow an easily recognizable header format. However, if you want to hide the fact that you are encrypting your files, enabling this option will provide you with plausible deniability. The output volume will indistinguishable from a stream of random bytes, and no one can prove it is a volume without the correct password. \r\nRecursively: If you want to encrypt and/or decrypt a large set of files individually, this option will tell Picocrypt to go through every recursive file that you drop in and encrypt/decrypt it separately. This is useful, for example, if you are encrypting thousands of large documents and want to be able to decrypt any one of them in particular without having to download and decrypt the entire set of documents. \r\n","version":"1.42"},{"app_id":"io.github.pieterdd.RcloneShuttle","name":"Rclone Shuttle","summary":"Upload your files to anywhere","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/pieterdd.RcloneShuttle/e1284299c2035c136fc08702fedaa4cd/icons/128x128/io.github.pieterdd.RcloneShuttle.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/pieterdd.RcloneShuttle/e1284299c2035c136fc08702fedaa4cd/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/pieterdd.RcloneShuttle/e1284299c2035c136fc08702fedaa4cd/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/pieterdd.RcloneShuttle/e1284299c2035c136fc08702fedaa4cd/screenshots/image-3_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/pieterdd.RcloneShuttle/e1284299c2035c136fc08702fedaa4cd/screenshots/image-4_orig.png"],"categories":"Network","rich_description":"(Rclone Shuttle is still experimental.

Details about this optional hosting service can be found on the Obsidian website.\r\n\r\n This distribution is verified by the Obsidian team but isn't supported\r\n\r\n Wayland support can enabled with --socket=wayland in Flatseal which can enable features like pinch zoom\r\n\r\n GPU acceleration can be disabled if necessary by setting OBSIDIAN_DISABLE_GPU=1 in Flatseal\r\n\r\n Pdflatex support in pandoc currently requires installing the org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive SDK\r\n\r\n Note: Regular users should disable \"Automatic Updates\" within Obsidian as public release updates are handled by Flatpak itself. Insiders should keep this enabled to receive insider builds, as those will not be made available on Flathub.\r\n\r\n This flatpak goes into great lengths to provide a nice experience for end users. In order for the Git plugin to work it requires permission to the ssh-auth socket (--socket=ssh-auth). It also exposes the home directory in the sandbox (required for Drag and Drop operations). If you don't use the Git plugin you can disable the ssh-auth socket permission, e.g. using Flatseal. You can also remove access to the home directory if you want and the flatpak will continue to work, albeit with reduced functionality. In case you do remove access to the homedir, note that in order for things to not break for the Git plugin, --persist=.ssh flag has been passed and a bind mount to ~/.var/app/md.obsidian.Obsidian/ is created by flatpak, allowing that location to be used for persistent data (but your home directory's .ssh remains unaccessible)","version":"1.7.7"},{"app_id":"me.acristoffers.Lachesis","name":"Lachesis","summary":"Moirai supervisor","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/icons/128x128/me.acristoffers.Lachesis.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/screenshots/image-3_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/screenshots/image-4_orig.png"],"categories":"Science,Development","rich_description":"Lachesis is the frontend of the control platform.

Upgrade to a paid plan to get more done and support our mission. \r\n Easy to use — Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to read, organize, and write your emails. \r\n Your inbox is yours — We don’t spy on your communications to show you targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules. \r\n Rigorous encryption — Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No one can read your emails but you. Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access encryption. \r\n Unmatched protection — We offer strong phishing, spam, and spying/tracking protection for all your communications. \r\n \r\n\r\nIndustry Leading Security Features\r\n\r\n Messages are stored on Proton Mail servers using end-to-end encryption at all times and are transmitted securely between Proton servers and user devices. This largely eliminates the risk of message interception. \r\n\r\n Zero Access to Your Email Content\r\n\r\n Proton Mail's zero access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a way that makes it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to. This means we don't have the technical ability to decrypt your messages. \r\n\r\n Open-Source Cryptography\r\n\r\n Proton Mail's open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security experts from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection. Proton Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP, while all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using open-source libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption algorithms used do not have clandestinely built-in back doors. \r\n\r\n Proton Mail in the press:\r\n\r\n “Proton Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption, making it impossible for outside parties to monitor.” Forbes \r\n\r\n “A new email service being developed by a group who met at MIT and CERN promises to bring secure, encrypted email to the masses and keep sensitive information away from prying eyes.” Huffington Post ","version":"1.2.4"},{"app_id":"me.proton.Pass","name":"Proton Pass","summary":"Encrypted password manager to keep your login credentials safe","content_rating":"money-purchasing:intense","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/me/proton/Pass/bab67cd61e554b2b24fb408d31924d5b/icons/128x128/me.proton.Pass.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/me/proton/Pass/bab67cd61e554b2b24fb408d31924d5b/icons/128x128@2/me.proton.Pass.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/me/proton/Pass/bab67cd61e554b2b24fb408d31924d5b/screenshots/image-1_orig.png"],"categories":"Utility","rich_description":"NOTE: This a wrapper of the official packages, but it is not verified, affiliated with, or supported by Proton AG. \r\n\r\n Get the password manager created by the scientists who met at CERN behind Proton Mail, the world’s largest encrypted email provider.

It's just to have some fun playing against the AI. The only additions: you can undo moves; and the AI will indicate when it thinks the position is dead even (you may take that as the AI offering a draw). You, on the other hand, cannot offer a draw: that would be pointless, as the AI is not designed to handle it anyway. Just quit or start a new game if you feel the current game is going nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe AI uses a Monte Carlo tree search variation with a hand crafted evaluation function that is based on pattern counts (e.g., the number of open mills) and also has perfect knowledge of the game theoretic values of all 3 on 3 positions.\r\n\r\nMuehle is distributed free of charge and comes without any (not even implied) waranties.

RetroDECK is powered by EmulationStation Desktop Edition, that uses RetroArch and other standalone emulators to allow you to import and play your favorite games in a tidy environment. No other software is needed as everything it's already included in one package!\r\n\r\n BETA NOTICE: RetroDECK is still in Beta and the team is actively developing and adding more features. The primary focus during the beta period is on SteamOS and the Steam Deck but we hope to expand to more devices and general Linux desktop in the future\r\n\r\n NOTE: It can be run on Linux desktop right now but there will be some manual configurations needed for input, storage location and other tiny hickups.\r\n\r\n INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STEAM DECK: 1. Start RetroDECK from the Desktop mode (only needed for the initial first time configuration) 2. Add RetroDECK to your Steam Library by pressing \"Add a non-steam game to my library\" 3.

Similar support is also available for GTK.","version":"1.1.3"},{"app_id":"org.flightgear.FlightGear","name":"FlightGear","summary":"A free and highly sophisticated flight simulator","content_rating":"social-chat:intense","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/icons/128x128/org.flightgear.FlightGear.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/icons/128x128@2/org.flightgear.FlightGear.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-3_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-4_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-5_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-6_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-7_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-8_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-9_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-10_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-11_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-12_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-13_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-14_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-15_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-16_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-17_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-18_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-19_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-20_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-21_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-22_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-23_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-24_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/flightgear/FlightGear/b2e3ebc1197e9c8b6a3f5a0547016d54/screenshots/image-25_orig.png"],"categories":"Game,Simulation","rich_description":"FlightGear allows you to control over 400 aircraft, small and large in a range of situations, types of weather, seasons, day and night cycle.

Individual wallets have a 25 word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.\r\n\r\n Untraceability: By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of a certain type of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.","version":"0.18.3.4"},{"app_id":"org.getoutline.OutlineClient","name":"Outline","summary":"Access to the free and open Internet","screenshots":["https://github.com/flathub/flathub/raw/0cc3683ec3d6832863b032993301edc25ce1a818/screenshot.png"],"categories":"Network","rich_description":"The Outline app allows users with access keys to connect to the Outline server and the open web through their connected devices.\r\n\r\nConnect to your server using your unique access key, generated by the Outline Manager.

Unlike SSH, Mosh can be used while switching between Wi-Fi networks or from Wi-Fi to cellular data to wired Ethernet.\r\nThe Mosh client runs a predictive model of the server's behavior in the background and tries to guess intelligently how each keystroke will affect the screen state. When it is confident in its predictions, it will show them to the user while waiting for confirmation from the server. Most typing and uses of the left- and right-arrow keys can be echoed immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, Mosh is usable on high-latency links, e.g. on a cellular data connection or spotty Wi-Fi. In distinction from previous attempts at local echo modes in other protocols, Mosh works properly with full-screen applications such as emacs, vi, alpine, and irssi, and automatically recovers from occasional prediction errors within an RTT. On high-latency links, Mosh underlines its predictions while they are outstanding and removes the underline when they are confirmed by the server.\r\n\r\nMosh does not support X forwarding or the non-interactive uses of SSH, including port forwarding.","version":"1.4.0"},{"app_id":"org.mozilla.Thunderbird","name":"Thunderbird","summary":"Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring client","screenshots":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thunderbird/flatpak-screenshots/main/image_1.png","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thunderbird/flatpak-screenshots/main/image_2.png"],"categories":"Calendar,Chat,ContactManagement,Email,Feed,IRCClient,InstantMessaging,Network,News,Office","rich_description":"Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring client, that’s easy to set up and customize.

Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.\r\n\r\n OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.\r\n\r\n OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is constructive solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion of 2D outlines. As data exchange format for this 2D outlines Autocad DXF files are used. In addition to 2D paths for extrusion it is also possible to read design parameters from DXF files. Besides DXF files OpenSCAD can read and create 3D models in the STL and OFF file formats.","version":"2021.01"},{"app_id":"org.openscopeproject.TrguiNG","name":"TrguiNG","summary":"Remote GUI for Transmission torrent daemon","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/icons/128x128/org.openscopeproject.TrguiNG.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/icons/128x128@2/org.openscopeproject.TrguiNG.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-2_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-3_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-4_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-5_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-6_orig.png"],"categories":"Network,Utility","rich_description":"TrguiNG is an alternative UI for controlling transmission torrent daemon running on the same machine or any other host that has exposed transmission rpc endpoint.\r\n\r\n Features:\r\n\r\n \r\nMulti tabbed interface for concurrent server connections \r\nTorrent creation with fast multi threaded hashing \r\nPowerful torrent filtering options \r\nEfficient network usage \r\nConfigurable path mappings to directly access torrent files if their location is mounted locally \r\nLatest transmission features support: labels, bandwidth groups, sequential download \r\nDark/light/custom theme support \r\n \r\n\r\nRequires transmission server version 2.40 or later.","version":"1.4.0"},{"app_id":"org.openshot.OpenShot","name":"OpenShot Video Editor","summary":"An easy to use, quick to learn, and surprisingly powerful video editor","content_rating":"social-info:moderate","icons":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openshot/OpenShot/c98cc7078a6bdff0c1a83fb8ba798f54/icons/128x128/org.openshot.OpenShot.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openshot/OpenShot/c98cc7078a6bdff0c1a83fb8ba798f54/icons/128x128@2/org.openshot.OpenShot.png"],"screenshots":["https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openshot/OpenShot/c98cc7078a6bdff0c1a83fb8ba798f54/screenshots/image-1_orig.png","https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openshot/OpenShot/c98cc7078a6bdff0c1a83fb8ba798f54/screenshots/image-2_orig.png"],"categories":"AudioVideo,Video,AudioVideoEditing","rich_description":"OpenShot Video Editor is an award-winning, open-source video editor, available on Linux, Mac, Chrome OS, and Windows.

Re-attaching your client will show your IRC session in the same state as you left it in (plus whatever happened while you were gone), and this even when you re-attach from a different location. In addition, Quassel IRC can be used like a traditional client, with providing both client and core functionality in one binary. This so-called \"Monolithic Client\" completely hides the distributed nature, so for a purely local installation, Quassel IRC can be setup very easily.\r\n\r\nCross-platform means that Quassel IRC is developed for and tested on Linux®, Windows®, and MacOS X®. It should also run on any other platform that is supported by the Qt library. Third-party mobile clients for Android and iOS also exist.\r\n\r\nBy modern we mean that Quassel IRC will have all the features you'd expect from an IRC client nowadays.

A wide array of diving statistics and information is calculated and displayed, like the user's SAC rate, partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and many more.\r\n\r\n The dive profiles (and the tank pressure curves) can be visualized in a comprehensive and clean way, that provides the user with additional information on relative velocity (and momentary air consumption) during the dive. Subsurface also allows the user to print out a detailed log book that includes dive profiles and other relevant information. The program is localized in about 20 languages and well supported by an active developer community."},{"app_id":"org.subtitld.Subtitld","name":"Subtitld","summary":"Subtitld is a software to create and edit subtitles","screenshots":["https://subtitld.org/user/pages/01.home/subtitld_screenshot_.png"],"categories":"AudioVideo,Video","rich_description":"Subtitld is an open source software to edit, transcribe and create subtitles.

The software also allows closed-loop interventions via its built-in Python scripting support. It is specifically designed for use in (neuro)scientific in vivo behavior experiments. \r\n\r\n The modularity of this software allows its use for a wide variety of experiments and it often can be used without any programming skills. Data sources, sinks and processing blocks can be connected graphically with virtual \"wires\" to form a data flow graph using drag & drop, to represent how data should be acquired, displayed or stored.

Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games and demos. Hatari is open source software and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).\r\n\r\n Hatari supports the emulation of most of the ST and STE hardware, including some special tricks like raster interrupts, border effects and PSG sample sound. A joystick can be emulated with the cursor keys or with a real PC joystick. Hatari also features the possibility to \"mount\" a directory of the host system as a ST drive, or to use images from an original Atari's hard disk. Hatari is also able to emulate the additional hardware of the TT or Falcon machines, like the Videl video chip or the DSP 56001.

It can handle general-purpose C/C++ projects as well. Additionally, it is an excellent IDE for people starting their journey with C/C++ programming and looking for an easy-to-use environment with features like a simple build system, code completion, code formatting, and debugger support. \r\n\r\n U++ is a C++ cross-platform rapid application development framework focused on programmers productivity. It includes a set of libraries (GUI, SQL, Network, etc.), and an integrated development environment. \r\n\r\n Rapid development is achieved by the smart and aggressive use of C++ rather than through fancy code generators. In this respect, U++ competes with popular scripting languages while preserving C/C++ runtime characteristics. \r\n\r\n The U++ integrated development environment, TheIDE, introduces modular concepts to C++ programming.

The most notables ones are: \r\n\r\n \r\nA modern OpenGL 3.2 renderer, providing a greatly enhanced look and feel. The original OpenGL 1.4 and even the Software renderers are still supported. Both 3D accelerated renderers support anisotropic filtering and multisampling anti aliasing. \r\nFull support for widescreen displays and arbitrary resolutions. The HUD can be scaled to be readable on high resolutions. \r\nSupport for surround sound, from stereo up to 7.1 channels and even HRTF. The background music can be played from OGG/Vorbis files, a CD drive is no longer necessary. \r\nA rewritten savegame system. Yamagi Quake II savegames are completely reliable and backward compatible between releases as long as the principle architecture stays the same. \r\nHighly precise timings. For example, on a flat panel display with a 59.95 hertz refresh rate and vertical synchronisation (VSync) enabled Yamagi Quake II is running at exactly 59.95 frames per second. \r\nIn comparison with the original client over 1.500 bugs were fixed. The Yamagi Quake II client is very well tested and stable. The dedicated server is able to run for weeks without a single restart. Last but not least the code is fully 64 bit clean and highly portable. \r\n \r\n\r\n Commercial data files are required to run the supported game. These can be aquired though a multitude of sources.

The same can be done while shopping: Tag items for where you can get them and click on the tag when you are there. \r\nhide temporary: Imagine you have a long shopping list but not enough money with you or some items would be to heavy/big to carry so you decide to get it next time.

Unlike most social networks today, it is not run by a company which has power over the communications between users. The developers of Manyverse can control the source code to build the app and ship new features, but they have no access to user data. The user has complete ownership and responsibility over their data.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to make social networking independent of internet connectivity. Hence the slogan \"off the grid\". This quality is essential for populations disconnected from the internet (such as in Africa and Latin America) who want to benefit from modern social networking to communicate in their communities.\r\n\r\nThe secondary goal of this project is to make social networking a neutral public utility for people of all kinds. Neutrality requires this project to be non-commercial, so that profit seeking never interferes with communications between its users, even in the long run. Neutrality also requires that the software developers have no access to and no liability for user content, to create an unbiased environment. Like the internet and the web are decentralized protocols, their inventors are also not liable for content on the web, and thus the web is a more neutral space than proprietary social medias such as Twitter or LinkedIn.\r\n\r\nUnderneath, Manyverse uses the Secure Scuttlebutt protocol, also known as SSB. This protocol is somewhat like HTTP or RSS, in the sense that it describes how different apps can communicate with each other over the internet or over other networking channels such as Bluetooth.
