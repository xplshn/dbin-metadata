It supports various input formats and can create beautiful presentation slides or export the presentation to various output formats (pictures, pptx, WhatsApp messages and a lot more) so that it can be used for a variety of purposes.

 Cantara has the following advantages:

 
Super-fast and lightweight: Cantara is less then 10 MB of size and uses the components available on the local operation system as far as possible. It contains no bloatware. It can be run on an old computer, a raspberry-pi and many more. 
Very easy to use: Accepts the most common input format (CCLI songselect lyrics file) and creats the presentation slides for an event in only a few seconds. The usage is very intuitive and user-friendly. 
Good integration with other presentation software: Cantara can export presentations to the PPTX format and therefore integrates easily with other presentation software like LibreOffice Impress or MS Powerpoint. It can be included in a complex workflow like a church service or even an online streaming event via OBS. In addition, you can export the lyrics to text formats and share them in messenger groups, as a HTML page etc. 
Multi-Screen-Support: Multi Screen is supported out of the box. 
Customizable Design and good outlook: The colors and fonts can be configured in the settings. In addition, you can set up a background picture and adjust itâ€™s brightness/transparency. The presentations look beautiful and are easy to read. 
Multi language support: Cantara can present and export song presentations in two different languges at the same time. 
Free and Open Source: No license fees, no dependence on certain companiesâ€“Cantara is licensed under the GPL-3 and can be used everywhere and as you want. 
Used all over the world and continuously developed: Although Cantara is still a quite young project, people from many countries are using it. It has been translated to several langauges. In the future, more functions are going to be implemented.

 Security assessment was done by Trail of Bits in November 2022.

 SimpleX Chat features:

 
end-to-end encrypted messages, with editing, replies and deletion of messages. 
sending end-to-end encrypted images and files. 
single-use and long-term user addresses. 
secret chat groups - only group members know it exists and who is the member. 
end-to-end encrypted audio and video calls. 
private instant notifications. 
portable chat profile - you can transfer your chat contacts and history to another device (terminal or mobile). 
 

SimpleX Chat advantages:

 
Full privacy of your identity, profile, contacts and metadata: unlike any other existing messaging platform, SimpleX uses no phone numbers or any other identifiers assigned to the users - not even random numbers. This protects the privacy of who you are communicating with, hiding it from SimpleX platform servers and from any observers. 
Complete protection against spam and abuse: as you have no identifier on SimpleX platform, you cannot be contacted unless you share a one-time invitation link or an optional temporary user address. 
Full ownership, control and security of your data: SimpleX stores all user data on client devices, the messages are only held temporarily on SimpleX relay servers until they are received. 
Decentralized network: you can use SimpleX with your own servers and still communicate with people using the servers that are pre-configured in the apps or any other SimpleX servers. 
 

You can connect to anybody you know via link or scan QR code (in the video call or in person) and start sending messages instantly - no emails, phone numbers or passwords needed.

 Your profile and contacts are only stored in the app on your device - our servers do not have access to this information.

 All messages are end-to-end encrypted using open-source double-ratchet protocol; the messages are routed via our servers using open-source SimpleX Messaging Protocol.§Version¥6.1.1‰¥AppId²chat.tandem.Client¤Name¦Tandem§Summary¿Virtual office for remote teams­ContentRatingÙ<social-chat:intense,social-info:intense,social-audio:intense¥Icons‘Ùuhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/chat/tandem/Client/9510d355b749332db73243af44b4ea24/icons/128x128/chat.tandem.Client.png«Screenshots‘Ùmhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/chat/tandem/Client/9510d355b749332db73243af44b4ea24/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories°InstantMessaging¯RichDescriptionÚXConnect effortlessly with your distributed team.

 API debugging: 

 Used for preliminary interface debugging during the interface development process or when the development is about to be delivered, to verify whether the interface meets expectations 

 Automated testing:

 Used for automated testing of complex scenarios by testers after interface development is completed and delivered, in order to identify some issues 

 API documentation:

 Used to quickly generate beautiful and standard interface documents. And supports online formats such as HTML, Markdown, Word, etc

 Real time collaboration among multiple people:

 The above 5 The large module involves multiple roles of the R&D team, and Apipost connects each role and their work scenarios through real-time collaboration.

 Suspend Games

Pause games that can't normally be paused (single-player games like Dark Souls, Elden Ring, etc) 
Suspend games whose pause screens keep the system running hot or playing unwanted music

 Nyrna can be used to suspend normal, non-game applications as well. For example:

 
3D renders 
video encoding 
software compilation 
 

The CPU and GPU resources are being used by said task - maybe for hours - when you would like to use the system for something else.

 It's designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible, while still delivering unique features that you'll actually use. Additionally, Saber is available across all your devices, large and small, and syncs between them seamlessly. 

 Notably, it can invert your notes when you're in dark mode. This allows you to write with white ink on a black background, which is much easier on the eyes in low-light environments like when the teacher turns off the lights in class. Images and PDFs are also inverted, so you can still use a digital printout or a textbook without the fuss. 

 Saber uses a dual-password system to protect your notes from anyone but you, even if they have complete control over the server. You can safely store your notes on the official Saber server, another server, or even host your own! 

 The app is completely open-source so that anyone can view the source code and see exactly what it's doing and how it handles your data. Many other note-taking apps are closed-source and proprietary, meaning that their inner workings are a mystery to the public. 

 As someone who studies maths, highlighting multi-line equations was always a hassle with other apps, where the highlighter would change color when it overlapped with itself. Another problem I had was that in some apps, the highlighter would render on top of the text, fading it out and making it hard to read. Saber's highlighter has no such issues. It utilizes canvas compositing to render the highlighter in a way that is consistent with/better than traditional paper, where it handles overlaps and maintains color consistency. 

 Saber has everything you need to keep your notes organized. Create folders inside folders inside folders to your heart's content with no limit on the number of nested folders. And even though a note may be buried deep within a nested folder, you can still access it easily with your most recent notes always available on the home screen. 

 Discover a whole new way to capture and organize your thoughts with Saber. Whether you're a student, professional, or creative mind, Saber is your trusted companion for digital handwriting.

 Password theft is a serious problem. The websites and apps that you use are under attack every day. Security breaches occur and your passwords are stolen. When you reuse the same passwords across apps and websites hackers can easily access your email, bank, and other important accounts. 

 Security experts recommend that you use a different, randomly generated password for every account that you create. But how do you manage all those passwords? Bitwarden makes it easy for you to create, store, and access your passwords. 

 Bitwarden stores all of your logins in an encrypted vault that syncs across all of your devices. Since it's fully encrypted before it ever leaves your device, only you have access to your data. Not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data, even if we wanted to. Your data is sealed with AES-256 bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256. 

 Bitwarden is 100% open source software. The source code for Bitwarden is hosted on GitHub and everyone is free to review, audit, and contribute to the Bitwarden codebase. §Version©2024.11.1‰¥AppId·com.bitwig.BitwigStudio¤Name­Bitwig Studio§SummaryÙ'Modern music production and performance­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/icons/128x128/com.bitwig.BitwigStudio.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/icons/128x128@2/com.bitwig.BitwigStudio.png«Screenshots›Ùrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-6_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-7_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-8_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-9_orig.pngÙshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-10_orig.pngÙshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/bitwig/BitwigStudio/518f2ad271bd22f3ac40a18fcb6db4bc/screenshots/image-11_orig.pngªCategoriesÙ;AudioVideo,Music,Audio,Sequencer,Midi,Mixer,Player,Recorder¯RichDescriptionÚ~Bitwig Studio is a digital audio workstation (DAW) that inspires you to take greater control of your music, giving you access to every aspect of your production.

Altering the layout, font size, or spacing after the fact is incredibly time-consuming. And donâ€™t even think about hitting an exact runtime requirement while circumnavigating the shimmer trap.

 But there is a better way: Cinecred, a free and open source program to create credits without the pain. Cinecred reads your credits data from an Excel, LibreOffice, or Google spreadsheet, and then lets you interactively arrange and style the credits in any way you like. Thereâ€™s a default template that gets you off the ground quickly, but everything can be customized down to the pixel. Use your own fonts or insert logos, pictures, or even videos. And once youâ€™re done, check the scroll in the integrated player, before exporting it in a plethora of video and image sequence formats.§Version¥1.7.0‰¥AppId½com.claudiocambra.brickbuster¤Name«BrickBuster§SummaryÙ(A brick-breaker game, fun and addictive!­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots—Ùhhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/claucambra/BrickBuster/main/screenshots/Screenshot_20210623-001735.jpgÙhhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/claucambra/BrickBuster/main/screenshots/Screenshot_20210623-003011.jpgÙhhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/claucambra/BrickBuster/main/screenshots/Screenshot_20210623-002435.jpgÙhhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/claucambra/BrickBuster/main/screenshots/Screenshot_20210623-002250.jpgÙhhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/claucambra/BrickBuster/main/screenshots/Screenshot_20210623-002227.jpgÙhhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/claucambra/BrickBuster/main/screenshots/Screenshot_20210623-002140.jpgÙhhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/claucambra/BrickBuster/main/screenshots/Screenshot_20210623-001752.jpgªCategories¥Games¯RichDescriptionÚBrickBuster is a brick-breaker type game where the objective is to survive as many rounds as possible.

This is the fastest screen recording tool for Linux. This screen recorder works on X11 and Wayland on AMD, Intel and NVIDIA. 

 This screen recorder can be used for recording your desktop offline, for live streaming and for nvidia-like instant replay, where only the last few minutes are saved. 

 Supported video codecs:

 
H264 (default) 
HEVC (Optionally with HDR) 
AV1 (Optionally with HDR. Not currently supported on NVIDIA if you use GPU Screen Recorder flatpak) 
VP8 
VP9 
 

Supported audio codecs:

 
Opus (default) 
AAC 
 

 Recording a monitor requires (restricted) root access which means that you have to install GPU Screen Recorder system-wide: "flatpak install --system com.dec05eba.gpu_screen_recorder" and pkexec needs to be installed on the system and a polkit agent needs to be running. Note that this only applies to when recording a monitor on AMD/Intel or when recording on Wayland without using the desktop portal option. 

 AV1 is currently not supported in the flatpak for Nvidia since GPU Screen Recorder uses an older ffmpeg version to support older Nvidia cards. Install GPU Screen Recorder from source or from AUR if you want to use AV1 on Nvidia.

 Videos are in variable framerate format. Very out of date video players might have an issue playing such videos. It's recommend to use MPV to play such videos, otherwise you might experience stuttering in the video. You can select constant frame rate mode in advanced view if you need it. 

 If the video doesn't play or you get green/yellow overlay then your video player is missing H264/HEVC video codec. Either install the video codecs or use mpv. 

 AMD has a driver/hardware fault that causes black bars/distorted colors on the sides of the video for certain video resolutions. This happens for both av1 and hevc, so if you have this issue then switch to h264 video codec option in advanced settings. 

 If H264/HEVC video encoding option is not available on your AMD/Intel system but you know that your GPU supports those codecs for encoding then you may need to install mesa-extra freedesktop runtime by running this command: "flatpak install --system org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default//23.08-extra". 

 On NVIDIA systems the flatpak NVIDIA driver needs to match the systems NVIDIA driver version or the NVIDIA driver will fail to properly load in flatpaks. Make sure you update flatpak on your system with: "flatpak update", or if that doesn't fix it you can try to install the specific flatpak NVIDIA driver version version that matches your systems NVIDIA driver version by running: "flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.nvidia-version", for example "flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.nvidia-550-54-14". You can find which NVIDIA driver version is running on your system by running "cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version". 

 GPU Screen Recorder flatpak can install files in $HOME/.local/share/gpu-screen-recorder. If you want to uninstall GPU Screen Recorder then you will have to remove this directory manually.§Version¥4.3.3‰¥AppId½com.dhsdevelopments.Climaxima¤Name©Climaxima§Summary·Frontend for Maxima CAS­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots‘ÙQhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/lokedhs/maxima-client/master/doc/screenshot.pngªCategories§Science¯RichDescriptionÙ1Climaxima is a user interface building on Maxima.§Versionµrelease-2021-09-23_02‰¥AppId¾com.diffingo.fwbackups.desktop¤Name©fwbackups§SummaryÙ,A feature-rich, user-friendly backup program­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots”ÙPhttps://diffingo.com/oss/sites/default/files/screenshots/fwbackups/Set-Times.pngÙWhttps://diffingo.com/oss/sites/default/files/screenshots/fwbackups/OneTime-Settings.pngÙPhttps://diffingo.com/oss/sites/default/files/screenshots/fwbackups/LogViewer.pngÙThttps://diffingo.com/oss/sites/default/files/screenshots/fwbackups/OneTime-Paths.pngªCategoriesµArchiving,GTK,Utility¯RichDescriptionÙvA feature-rich user backup program that allows you to backup your documents on a one-off or recurring scheduled basis.§Versionª1.43.8-rc2‰¥AppId¶com.discordapp.Discord¤Name§Discord§SummaryÙ!Messaging, voice and video client­ContentRatingÙmsocial-chat:intense,social-info:intense,social-audio:intense,social-contacts:intense,money-purchasing:intense¥Icons‘Ù}https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/discordapp/Discord/f6ad36464d3bf5acf1e59912fcab8eff/icons/128x128/com.discordapp.Discord.png«Screenshots“Ùqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/discordapp/Discord/f6ad36464d3bf5acf1e59912fcab8eff/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/discordapp/Discord/f6ad36464d3bf5acf1e59912fcab8eff/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/discordapp/Discord/f6ad36464d3bf5acf1e59912fcab8eff/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories¸InstantMessaging,Network¯RichDescriptionÚ^Discord is a free all in one messaging, voice, and video client thats available on your computer and phone.

DOS-based Windows such as Windows 3.x and Windows 9x are officially supported. Compared to DOSBox, DOSBox-X is much more flexible and provides more features. 

 DOSBox-X emulates a PC necessary for running many DOS games and applications that simply cannot be run on modern PCs and operating systems, similar to DOSBox. However, while the main focus of DOSBox is for running DOS games, DOSBox-X goes much further than this. Started as a fork of the DOSBox project, it retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for. But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows. By adding official support for Windows 95, 98, and ME emulation and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games and applications could be enjoyed or used once more. Moreover, DOSBox-X adds support for emulating the NEC PC-98 such that you can also play PC-98 games with it. §Versionª2024.10.01‰¥AppId¾com.doycho.euterpe.gtk.desktop¤Name§Euterpe§SummaryÙ)Audio player for the Euterpe media server­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/icons/128x128/com.doycho.euterpe.gtk.desktop.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/icons/128x128@2/com.doycho.euterpe.gtk.desktop.png«ScreenshotsšÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-6_orig.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-7_orig.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-8_orig.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-9_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/doycho/euterpe.gtk.desktop/3edbc5b0540f9825b5597e035d64249b/screenshots/image-10_orig.pngªCategoriesÙ!AudioVideo,Audio,Player,GTK,GNOME¯RichDescriptionÚÉMobile and desktop player for the self-hosted Euterpe streaming server.

Go on an adventure to connect the water pipes and bring water back to your village. Solve puzzles and hack your way through 15 levels of fun and challenging islands. You may discover that you'll learn some things along the wayâ€¦

 Level up your coding skills by learning and practicing variables, conditionals, loops, debugging, JavaScript, math, step by step, booleans, logical sequencing, and more.

 The goal on each level is to connect all the pipes together. When near a pipe, â€œhackâ€ it to rotate and connect it to other pipes. Once this is done, a door appears. To reach the door, the character may have to hack other objects like platforms and bridges to change their position and scale. This may include changing water between ice, liquid, and steam to access different areas. The water must be in liquid form for the pipes to work. If the character ever ends up in a bad place, they will be reset to the nearest surface with no bad consequences.

 Important controls:

 
Move Mateo: Tap the mouse or trackpad on the screen 
Restart Button: Restart the level from the beginning 
Pause Button: Open options to change audio/continue level/return to level selection 
Eye Button: Click the eye in the bottom right to highlight hackable objects 
Token Button: See which code tokens you have used in the current level 
Zoom In/Out: Scroll the mouse wheel 
 

Hacking objects:

 
Right-click on white highlighted objects to see and change their code. 
Mateo needs to be close enough to the object. Red highlight means an object is too far. 
While hacking, any text with a box can be changed by tapping the box and selecting an option.

The menu can be opened through two dbus methods: showMenu and showDelayedMenu. Both methods can open the menu in a predefined fixed position or on mouse position.

 showMenu shows the menu instantly, but in certain circumstances there are problems with the menu not showing or not closing. In these cases use the showDelayedMenu, there is a default delay of 150 miliseconds, but can be changed (see example below).

 Open menu with dbus-send

 dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=com.georgefb.quickaccess /QuickAccess com.georgefb.QuickAccess.showMenu int32:x

 dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=com.georgefb.quickaccess /QuickAccess com.georgefb.QuickAccess.showDelayedMenu int32:200 int32:x

 Replace x with an int from 0 to 9 to set the preffered position to open the menu.

It's faster, leaner, and shipping today! It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on Mailcore2. It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero "CPU Wakes", which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features. 

 Mailspring comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send Later, Mail Rules, Templates and more. Mailspring Pro, which you can unlock with a monthly subscription, adds even more features for people who send a ton of email: link tracking, read receipts, mailbox analytics, contact and company profiles. All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send your email credentials to the cloud. §Version¦1.14.0‰¥AppId¶com.getpostman.Postman¤Name§Postman§SummaryÙ$Platform for building and using APIs­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù}https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/getpostman/Postman/85605c983663c22aeb9e060a932e7484/icons/128x128/com.getpostman.Postman.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/getpostman/Postman/85605c983663c22aeb9e060a932e7484/icons/128x128@2/com.getpostman.Postman.png«Screenshots‘Ùqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/getpostman/Postman/85605c983663c22aeb9e060a932e7484/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategoriesºDevelopment,WebDevelopment¯RichDescriptionÚ£Postman is the complete toolchain for API developers, used by 5 million developers and more than 100,000 companies worldwide to access 130 million APIs every month.

Hypatia finds definitions, explanations, and answers related to the text on your display without removing you from the context or making you navigate away.

 Use Hypatia either of two ways: manually, where you open the app and enter a word or phrase to search for, or automatically, where it reads text from your clipboard on launch, and can be triggered by a shortcut.

 Once you set a keyboard shortcut to open the app, you can copy text from the article you're reading, trigger the app, and a pop-up will give you instant information about whatever it is you're looking at.

 Or, if you prefer to use it in manual mode, you can open Hypatia and search directly for any topic by entering it into the search box.

You can quickly search and open any file you have previously interacted with using sioyek. 
You can search and jump to table of contents entries. 
You can jump to any referenced figure or bibliography item even if the PDF file doesn't provide links. 
You can also search the names of bibliography items in google scholar/libgen by middle clicking/shif+middle clicking on their name. 
You can open a quick overview of figures/references/tables/etc. by right clicking on them (Like Smart Jump, this feature works even if the document doesn't provide links). 
Bookmarks are similar to marks except they are named by a text string and they are all global. 
Highlight text using different kinds of highlight, you can search among all the highlights. 
You can customize all key bindings and some UI elements by editing keys_user.conf and prefs_user.conf. The default configurations are in keys.conf and prefs.conf 
 

Sometimes when reading a document you need to go back a few pages (perhaps to view a definition or something) and quickly jump back to where you were. You can achieve this by using marks. Marks are named locations within a PDF file (each mark has a single character name for example 'a' or 'm') which you can quickly jump to using their name. In the aforementioned example, before going back to the definition you mark your location and later jump back to the mark by invoking its name. Lower case marks are local to the document and upper case marks are global (this should be very familiar to you if you have used vim).

 Suppose you are reading a paragraph which references a figure which is not very close to the current location. Jumping back and forth between the current paragraph and the figure can be very annoying. Using portals, you can link the paragraph's location to the figure's location. Sioyek shows the closest portal destination in a separate window (which is usually placed on a second monitor). This window is automatically updated to show the closest portal destination as the user navigates the document.

 Under Wayland, Sioyek will use by default the Wayland backend, if you prefer the X11 backend you can force it with flatpak run --nosocket=wayland --socket=x11 com.github.ahrm.sioyek

Arrows can be seen at the edge of the field, which are used to move the rows and columns in which the squares are located. Connected squares of the same colour form an area which can be removed by clicking on it. The aim of the game is to remove areas as large as possible in the shortest possible time. The game is over when all squares have been removed or there is no longer any way of removing the remaining squares. However, you should use as few clicks as possible to remove all squares, as these will reduce the final score.§Version£2.0‰¥AppId·com.github.corna.Vivado¤NameºXilinx Vivado Design Suite§SummaryÙ,Xilinx Design Suite for hardware development­ContentRatingÙ+social-info:moderate,money-advertising:mild¥Icons’Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/corna.Vivado/07ad2cd5a0a53383dce2081f799f9726/icons/128x128/com.github.corna.Vivado.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/corna.Vivado/07ad2cd5a0a53383dce2081f799f9726/icons/128x128@2/com.github.corna.Vivado.png«Screenshots‘Ùrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/corna.Vivado/07ad2cd5a0a53383dce2081f799f9726/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories¯Development,IDE¯RichDescriptionÚ
–Vivado Design Suite is a software suite designed by Xilinx for the design, synthesis and analysis of HDL for its line of FPGAs and SoCs. Vivado Design Suite includes many tools, like Vivado, Vitis, Vitis HLS and many others. This package provides a flatpak wrapper over an official installation. As the Xilinx tools are not redistributable, this package does not contain any Xilinx-licensed material, which is instead downloaded on-the-fly through the official Xilinx installer. To install it, install the flatpak package, then run any Xilinx launcher and follow the instructions. To uninstall, just remove the flatpak package to remove this wrapper. Note that this does not remove the Xilinx installation; to remove it, run the launcher "Uninstall Xilinx Design Tools or Devices" (or run "flatpak uninstall com.github.corna.Vivado --delete-data" to wipe everything in in "~/.var/app/com.github.corna.Vivado/").

 Why can't I see some of my files in Vivado? - All the Xilinx tools handled by this wrapper run in a sandbox with limited filesystem access, only your downloads, documents and desktop folders are visibile. Either work in those directories or override the default permission (with "flatpak override com.github.corna.Vivado --filesystem=<path_here>").

 I get an error "Can't open project [...]. Please verify that the project still exist.", why? - Same as before, make sure that the project is in one of the allowed folders.

 I have created a project outside Desktop or Documents: where are they? - You can find the sandboxed filesystem in "~/var/app/com.github.corna.Vivado/".

 I can not access the hardware devices. - Have you installed the "cable drivers" (which are just udev rules) at the end of the installation? To install them, run: "cd ~/.var/app/com.github.corna.Vivado/data/xilinx-install/Vivado/<version>/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers/ && sudo ./install_drivers && sudo udevadm control --reload", then re-connect any hardware device.

 Can I deny internet access to the Xilinx tools? - Yes, just remove the corresponding permission with: "flatpak override com.github.corna.Vivado --unshare=network". Note that the license manager uses your MAC addresses, so you may experience issues with non free components.

 How can I install additional components? - Run the launcher "Add Xilinx Design Tools or Devices".

 Can I install an additional version of the Xilinx tools? - Yes, run "flatpak run --command=xilinx_install com.github.corna.Vivado".

 Barrier is software that mimics the functionality of a KVM switch, which historically would allow you to use a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple computers by physically turning a dial on the box to switch the machine you're controlling at any given moment. Barrier does this in software, allowing you to tell it which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen, or by using a keypress to switch focus to a different system.

 Barrier was forked from Symless's Synergy 1.9 codebase. Synergy was a commercialized reimplementation of the original CosmoSynergy written by Chris Schoeneman.

 What's different?

 Whereas Synergy has moved beyond its goals from the 1.x era, Barrier aims to maintain that simplicity. Barrier will let you use your keyboard and mouse from machine A to control machine B (or more). It's that simple.

 Project goals

 Hassle-free reliability. We are users, too. Barrier was created so that we could solve the issues we had with synergy and then share these fixes with other users.

 Compatibility. We use more than one operating system and you probably do, too. Windows, OSX, Linux, FreeBSD... Barrier should "just work". We will also have our eye on Wayland when the time comes.

 Communication. Everything we do is in the open. Our issue tracker will let you see if others are having the same problem you're having and will allow you to add additional information. You will also be able to see when progress is made and how the issue gets resolved.§Version°2.4.0-5.15-23.08‰¥AppId¾com.github.devalien.workspaces¤NameªWorkspaces§Summary¸Always be ready for work­ContentRatingÚ5violence-cartoon:none,violence-fantasy:none,violence-realistic:none,violence-bloodshed:none,violence-sexual:none,violence-desecration:none,violence-slavery:none,violence-worship:none,drugs-alcohol:none,drugs-narcotics:none,drugs-tobacco:none,sex-nudity:none,sex-themes:none,sex-homosexuality:none,sex-prostitution:none,sex-adultery:none,sex-appearance:none,language-profanity:none,language-humor:none,language-discrimination:none,social-chat:none,social-info:none,social-audio:none,social-location:none,social-contacts:none,money-purchasing:none,money-gambling:none¥IconsÀ«Screenshots•Ùfhttps://github.com/devalien/workspaces/raw/master/data/screenshots/workspaces-quick-launcher-light.pngÙehttps://github.com/devalien/workspaces/raw/master/data/screenshots/workspaces-quick-launcher-dark.pngÙchttps://github.com/devalien/workspaces/raw/master/data/screenshots/workspaces-preferences-light.pngÙkhttps://github.com/devalien/workspaces/raw/master/data/screenshots/workspaces-preferences-editing-light.pngÙkhttps://github.com/devalien/workspaces/raw/master/data/screenshots/workspaces-preferences-add-item-dark.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÙİMake working on different projects easy again!

List of servers, list of point of interests on those servers (applications, log files, databases, servers). It will securely store passwords and keys. It will also allow you to run commands (locally or on SSH servers), open terminals on remote SSH servers, and so on. The data is securely stored on-disk using SQLcipher, which uses 256-bit AES. The database is password-protected, but you can store the password in your OS keyring. Since the database is encrypted, you can put it in your dropbox (or similar account), to share it between computers.

Projectpad's target audience are people who today have to use several tools to do their work effectively: a keepass-like application, a series of text files with notes, and a few shell scripts. Instead of that, projectpad offers a streamlined, integrated solution.

Projectpad consists of two applications:


the GUI projectpad application, which allows you to enter/edit data, search it, open websites and so on (included in this flatpak);
the command-line ppcli application, which allows you to run commands, connect to servers, open files of interest and so on (must be installed separately, see https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/projectpad2).

It contains multiple analysis algorithms and tries to understand what is going on in your modpack. These analyses go as deep as trying to estimate amount of ores generated by the map generator, and as wide as calculating late-game base trying to figure how much of everything you are going to need. It knows which items are important and which are less important, which recipes are efficient and which are less efficient. YAFC handles recursive recipes extremely well, it uses Google OrTools as its model solver.

YAFC also includes several tools, the most important currently is "Never Enough Items" - it is FNEI on steroids, showing not only recipes to produce or consume an item, but also which recipes you probably want to use, and how much.

It is a highly addictive game, and never the same from round to round due to its randomly generated playing fields.

It is a deceptively simple game, the goal is to shoot the other spacecraft through the field of planets, but their gravity makes it tricky. The effects of the gravity mean that although it's easy to learn how to play, and to enjoy playing, it could take a lifetime to thoroughly master.

In order to hit your opponent, you can rotate you ship to aim in any direction, and you can change the power with which your projectile is launched - the initial speed at which it flies.

It offers a simple and easy to use interface to write down your thoughts and ideas. The app gives you an infinite vertical canvas (but limited horizontal space) without sacrificing the ability to easily export your notes in traditional printing formats (e.g. A2, A3, A4, etc...). 

 Here is a summary of the most important features: 

 
4 different paper backgrounds to choose from: Plain, Lined, Grid or Dotted with customisable spacing and backgrounds. 
Grid Snapping: in Scrivano you can toggle the grid snapping feature so that your drawings will automatically snap to grid lines in the background. This is very useful to easily draw tables, diagrams and lines. 
Automatic filling of strokes: toggle the paint bucket in the toolbar to fill your drawing shapes and strokes. 
Stickers: save your frequently used symbols and diagrams, so you can easily drag and drop whenever you need them. 
Insert images: paste or drag and drop any image on the canvas to unleash your creativity! 
Offline saving: save your notes anywhere on your main drive, so you can manage them however you please. 
Laser: Scrivano offers a special laser tool to quickly draw over your notes. Incredibly useful when sharing your screen or presenting something! 
Annotate PDF files: You can import your PDF books, lecture slides, articles and documents to annotate them using Scrivano's built-in inking tools. 
 

 NOTE: The flatpak version of the app runs in a sandbox environment and it can only read/write files from these folders: xdg-desktop, xdg-documents, xdg-download and xdg-pictures. If you want to circumvent this for more freedom, you can use Flatseal to override these restrictions. §Version§0.19.10‰¥AppId·com.github.sdv43.whaler¤Name¦Whaler§Summary»Docker Container Management­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/sdv43.whaler/62096c73469d64ff2b7d1522df45422d/icons/128x128/com.github.sdv43.whaler.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/sdv43.whaler/62096c73469d64ff2b7d1522df45422d/icons/128x128@2/com.github.sdv43.whaler.png«Screenshots“Ùrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/sdv43.whaler/62096c73469d64ff2b7d1522df45422d/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/sdv43.whaler/62096c73469d64ff2b7d1522df45422d/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/sdv43.whaler/62096c73469d64ff2b7d1522df45422d/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories³Development,Utility¯RichDescriptionÚ|Whaler provides basic functionality for managing Docker containers.

The objective is simple enough -- retrieve the fabled Amulet of Yendor from the 26th level -- but the dungeon is riddled with danger. Horrifying creatures and devious, trap-ridden terrain await. Yet it is also riddled with weapons, potions, and artifacts of forgotten power. Survival demands strength and cunning in equal measure as you descend, making the most of what the dungeon gives you. You will make sacrifices, narrow escapes, and maybe even some friends along the way -- but will you be one of the lucky few to return alive?§Version¤1.14‰¥AppId¼com.github.treagod.spectator¤Name©Spectator§SummaryÙ Comfortably test your REST APIs!­ContentRatingÚ5violence-cartoon:none,violence-fantasy:none,violence-realistic:none,violence-bloodshed:none,violence-sexual:none,violence-desecration:none,violence-slavery:none,violence-worship:none,drugs-alcohol:none,drugs-narcotics:none,drugs-tobacco:none,sex-nudity:none,sex-themes:none,sex-homosexuality:none,sex-prostitution:none,sex-adultery:none,sex-appearance:none,language-profanity:none,language-humor:none,language-discrimination:none,social-chat:none,social-info:none,social-audio:none,social-location:none,social-contacts:none,money-purchasing:none,money-gambling:none¥Icons’Ù‰https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/treagod.spectator/a9d364c93dd337dcedaeca815d536d59/icons/128x128/com.github.treagod.spectator.pngÙ‹https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/treagod.spectator/a9d364c93dd337dcedaeca815d536d59/icons/128x128@2/com.github.treagod.spectator.png«Screenshots“Ùwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/treagod.spectator/a9d364c93dd337dcedaeca815d536d59/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/treagod.spectator/a9d364c93dd337dcedaeca815d536d59/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/github/treagod.spectator/a9d364c93dd337dcedaeca815d536d59/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategoriesÙ"Network,Development,WebDevelopment¯RichDescriptionÙ¥Gives you the possibilty to test your REST application.

Current Limitations on the Flatpak:

 
Heroic will not find or use Wine and Proton Flatpak versions. At least for now.

It should find Proton from the Steam folder for both Steam Flatpak and non-Flatpak if they are on installed on the library inside your $HOME folder 
Heroic cannot access /usr/bin so it won't be able to find any wine or proton isntalled there for now.

Using natural language and drawing on ideas from linguistics and from literate programming, Inform is widely used as a medium for literary writing, as a prototyping tool in the games industry, and in education, both at school and university level (where Inform is often assigned material for courses on digital narrative).

The Inform project was created by Graham Nelson in 1993 and first came to the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop in 1995, and is now available as an app. It combines the core Inform software with full documentation, including two books and nearly 500 fully working examples. Connecting to the Inform website, it can automatically download and update extensions from a fully curated Public Library used by the world-wide Inform community. The app offers richly detailed indexing of projects and scales from tiny fictions like "Kate is a woman in the Research Lab" right up to enormous imaginary worlds whose source text runs to over 3 million words. Features for automated testing, packaging and releasing round out a fully-featured development environment for IF.

Inform is free, with no strings attached. What you make with it is yours, to publish on your website, sell, or give to your friends. There's a vibrant community of users who welcome newcomers (and the app will help you find a high-traffic forum for discussions). Lastly, Inform is continuously maintained and developed. All bug reports are examined and acted on (and the app will show you how to post them).

Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friendsâ€”and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character.

Omission challenges you to put your language detective skills to the test with a deceptively simple challenge: Find the missing letter! A famous quotation will be displayed, with all the instances of a single letter removed.

How fast can you figure out the missing letter? It's a race to beat the clock (unless you choose another mode) as you try to complete as many passages as you can. The faster you answer, the more points you gain.

Keep passwords in a secure vault, access when and where you need them.

 NordPass is designed by the same team that created a leading VPN service, now trusted by more than 12 million users - NordVPN. Therefore, security and simplicity are the top NordPass priorities.

 With NordPass, store your passwords and secure notes all in one place, access them on any device, and share them with people you trust. Your passwords are protected by the latest encryption algorithm, XChaCha20, and zero-knowledge architecture. Your passwords are yours to have - we know nothing.

 What does NordPass do?

 
Autosave. Forget saving your passwords manually. With NordPass, you can add them to your vault in a few simple clicks. 
Autofill. Scrolling through a database of logins and passwords isnâ€™t for you? Thatâ€™s what autofill is for. Let NordPass do the work. 
Password generator. Unique passwords are essential for truly secure accounts. With NordPass, you can generate them in a matter of seconds. 
Password strength checker. Using a password manager enhances your security, but it wonâ€™t help you if your passwords are easy to crack. Check how strong your passwords are before you use them on any accounts. 
Secure password sharing. We get it: sometimes, you need to share your passwords. If you do, you might as well share them safely with a secure password sharing feature. 
Secure all that matters. NordPass isnâ€™t just for passwords. Store and access all your secure notes, including your credit card details. 
Accessibility. Passwords should be accessed when and where you need them. Thatâ€™s why NordPass is available as a browser extension, as well as mobile and desktop apps. 
 

How much does NordPass cost?

 NordPass is free to use, whether it is a browser extension or an app. Want to access more features like secure password sharing or access your passwords on more than one device at once? Try NordPass Premium.

It is written mostly in C++ using a GTK+ front-end. It uses a patched version of dcraw for reading raw files, with an in-house solution which adds the highest quality support for certain camera models unsupported by dcraw and enhances the accuracy of certain raw files already supported by dcraw. It is notable for the advanced control it gives the user over the demosaicing and development process.

 RawTherapee is designed for developing raw files from a broad range of digital cameras, as well as HDR DNG files and non-raw image formats (JPEG, TIFF and PNG). The target audience ranges from enthusiast newcomers who wish to broaden their understanding of how digital imaging works to semi-professional photographers. Knowledge in color science is not compulsory, but it is recommended that you are eager to learn and ready to read our documentation (RawPedia) as well as look up basic concepts which lie outside the scope of RawPedia, such as color balance, elsewhere.

 Of course, professionals may use RawTherapee too while enjoying complete freedom, but will probably lack some peripheral features such as Digital Asset Management, printing, uploading, etc. RawTherapee is not aimed at being an inclusive all-in-one program, and the open-source community is sufficiently developed by now to offer all those peripheral features in other specialized software.§Version¤5.11‰¥AppIdÙ/com.realm667.Wolfenstein_Blade_of_Agony.desktop¤Name»Wolfenstein: Blade of Agony§SummaryÙIStory-driven FPS inspired by WWII shooters from the 90's and early 2000's­ContentRatingÚ/violence-fantasy:intense,violence-realistic:intense,violence-bloodshed:moderate,violence-desecration:moderate,violence-slavery:intense,drugs-alcohol:moderate,drugs-tobacco:moderate,sex-nudity:mild,sex-appearance:intense,language-profanity:moderate,language-humor:moderate,language-discrimination:intense¥IconsÀ«ScreenshotsœÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c1/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_213149.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c1/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_213447.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c1/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_213709.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c1/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_214335.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c2/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_215134.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c2/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_215459.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c2/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_215556.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c2/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_215635.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c3/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_222455.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c3/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_222722.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c3/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_223126.jpgÙQhttps://boa.realm667.com/images/screenshots/c3/Screenshot_BoA_20210418_223435.jpgªCategories¯ActionGame,Game¯RichDescriptionÚ›Blade of Agony is a story-driven FPS. The project is inspired by WWII shooters from the 90's and early 2000's, like Wolfenstein 3D, Medal of Honor, and Call of Duty, but with faster-paced gameplay in the spirit of Doom! The game can be played standalone using the GZDoom engine as a base.

STORY It's 1942, and the war approaches its peak. The U.S. has joined the Allied forces, and the Soviets are pushing back the front in the east. The tides of war are turning, and Hitler's victory seems more and more beyond his grasp. But the Nazis, refusing to capitulate, have grown obsessed with human experiments and occult artifacts, in which they see a potential escape from their final Doom. The Allied leaders reject this possibility as nonsense; nonetheless, some still fear what the FÃ¼hrer might be up to. The situation is nebulous, however, and little is certain.

You are Cpt. William "B.J." Blazkowicz, an Allied spy, a fearless risk-taker, and the greatest soldier to ever take up arms in World War II. Your role has changed, though; you've retired from active duty, and now you spearhead operations as a systems analyst. You thought it would be the right choice--leading and motivating instead of doing the dirty work--but lately you've grown restless. At least until a few days ago, when you received an encrypted message from your old friend and comrade Cpt. Douglas Blake, calling you back to duty...

FEATURES Blade of Agony is much more than just a pastiche of the classic shooters that inspired it; the project will offer a unique experience. It also has many features not often seen in source port projects--Blade of Agony truly pushes GZDoom to its limits.


36 playable and unique levels
Orchestra-quality game music
Voice acting and ambient soundscapes
A combination of low-poly models and hi-resolution sprite assets to create the perfect retro feeling
Devastating armaments from the battlefields of WWII
Interactive NPCs that support the twisted plot's progress and help you understand the game
Beautiful special effects (weather, elements, explosions, etc.)
Achievements system similar to those seen on Steam
Launcher which supports external addons

Your goal is to survive in the environment, adapt your species by adding mutations, and thrive. Other species will emerge to compete with yours. They will evolve via a population dynamics driven simulation with random mutations - you must improve and spread your species to surpass them. The success of your species depends both on your skill in surviving as an individual cell and the changes you make in the editor. 

 In the Microbe Stage, you control a single microbe or a colony of microbes bound together. You swim through a watery environment to find the resources your cell needs to stay alive and to reproduce. Once you have reproduced, you enter the editor, where you can review how well your species and others are surviving, move to new biomes, and modify your species. Add new organelles, change your membrane, and change your cell's visuals. Your goal is to become a more complex lifeform by first evolving the nucleus to become a eukaryote, then using binding agents to form cell colonies, the precursor to the first multicellular lifeforms. 

 Current key features:

 
 Control an individual member of your species and survive the environment 
 Predate on other species, use photosynsthesis or scavenge for resources 
 Edit your species to make it more successful 
 Compete with other species emerging on your planet via an evolution simulation 
 Explore different biomes 
 Fight other cells with multiple cellular level weapons 
 Try different gameplay styles by specializing in different energy sources in subsequent playthroughs 
 Learn about biology by using real compounds, organelles or parts inspired by real science 
 Spread your species via the biome map 
 Review and plan future actions by looking at population simulation results and graphs 
 Learn the basics of the game with a light interactive tutorial

§Version£2.0‰¥AppIdºcom.roguetemple.HyperRogue¤NameªHyperRogue§SummaryÙ'Non-euclidean graphical rogue-like game­ContentRatingÙ+violence-cartoon:mild,violence-fantasy:mild¥IconsÀ«Screenshots’Ù-https://roguetemple.com/z/hyper/alchemist.pngÙ,https://roguetemple.com/z/hyper/barriers.pngªCategories¯ActionGame,Game¯RichDescriptionÚdYou are a lone adventurer in a strange, non-Euclidean world. Gather as much treasure as you can before the nasty monsters get you. Explore about 50 different lands, each with its own unique treasures, enemies, and terrain obstacles. Your quest is to find the legendary treasure, the Orbs of Yendor. Collect one of them to win! Or just ignore your quest and collect smaller treasures.

The twist is the unique, unusual geometry of the world: it is one of just few games which takes place on the hyperbolic plane. Witness a grid composed of hexagons and heptagons, straight lines which seem to be parallel, but then they diverge and never cross, triangles whose angles add up to less than 180 degrees, how extremely unlikely is it to reach the same place twice due to practically infinite size of the world (centillions of locations in just 700 steps from the starting point), and how the world seems to be rotated when you do return. All this matters for the gameplay. The game is inspired by the roguelike genre (although in a very minimalist way), works of M. C. Escher, and by puzzle games such as Deadly Rooms of Death.§Version¥12.0c‰¥AppId¾com.rosegardenmusic.rosegarden¤NameªRosegarden§SummaryÙ,MIDI and Audio Sequencer and Notation Editor­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/rosegardenmusic/rosegarden/3c4e9956f4b96e10a23bcc01d1485819/icons/128x128/com.rosegardenmusic.rosegarden.png«Screenshots‘Ùyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/rosegardenmusic/rosegarden/3c4e9956f4b96e10a23bcc01d1485819/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories¿AudioVideo,Audio,Midi,Sequencer¯RichDescriptionÚlRosegarden is a general-purpose music composition and editing environment that offers a mixture of features inspired by MIDI sequencers, score editors, and DAWs. Rosegarden offers a variety of extensions that work in conjunction with LilyPond to produce beautiful scores that often require little or no manual editing, and it generally does a good job of rendering human MIDI performances as legible notation. 

 Rosegarden is ideal for the small scale home artist who wishes to use one tool to handle a music project from start to finish. For example, you can record your musical idea with a MIDI keyboard, write out transposing parts for the members of a brass band, and record the band playing these parts all in the same document in the same application. Rosegarden supports a variety of import and export formats, and works well in conjunction with other applications. §Version¥24.06‰¥AppId°com.rq3.Reaction¤Name¨Reaction§SummaryÙ"Movie realism first-person-shooter­ContentRatingÙšviolence-realistic:intense,violence-bloodshed:moderate,drugs-alcohol:mild,drugs-narcotics:mild,drugs-tobacco:mild,social-chat:intense,social-audio:intense¥Icons‘Ùqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/rq3/Reaction/4311494a8daf503e8b2393d9de77fe68/icons/128x128/com.rq3.Reaction.png«Screenshots“Ùkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/rq3/Reaction/4311494a8daf503e8b2393d9de77fe68/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/rq3/Reaction/4311494a8daf503e8b2393d9de77fe68/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/rq3/Reaction/4311494a8daf503e8b2393d9de77fe68/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories¯Game,ActionGame¯RichDescriptionÚ*Reaction Quake 3 ports Action Quake 2 to idTech3 for better graphics and enhanced gametypes like Teamplay, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Briefcase.

The economic model bears more resemblance to a turn-based strategy game. It features an espionage system that allows players to train and control spies individually, who each have a spying skill that increases over time. The player is also responsible for catching spies in their own kingdom. Inns built within the game allow players to hire mercenaries of various occupations, skill levels, and races. Skilled spies of enemy races are essential to a well-conducted espionage program, and the player can bolster his forces by grabbing a skilled fighter or give ones own factories, mines, and towers of science, a boost by hiring a skilled professional.

Every game is unique, with four different playable characters, randomized levels and enemies, and over 150 items to collect and use. The game is simple to get into, but has lots of depth. Strategy is required if you want to win!

 This game is based on the freely available source code of Pixel Dungeon. It began as a project to improve on the original game's quirks, but has since evolved into a separate game, with many unique features.

 Shattered Pixel Dungeon includes:

 
High replayability: Randomly generated levels, enemies, and items. No two games are the same! 
4 hero classes: Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Huntress. Each hero has a unique playstyle. 
8 subclasses: Successful heroes can refine their skills to become more powerful. 
5 distinct dungeon regions: each with their own enemies, traps, and quests. 
Over 150 different items: including powerful wands, rings, weapons, and armor. 
50+ different enemies, 30 different traps, and 5 bosses to test your skills. 
Unique artifacts, which grow in power as you use them. 
Updates, with new content roughly once a month. 
 

Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a 100% free game. There are no advertisements, microtransactions, or paywalls. An optional donation to support the game unlocks a couple of fun extras, but these are entirely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay.

It is both a rule set and an application for <em>Linux</em> and <em>Windows</em>.

In SlugChess you can only see a limited part of the game board based on the type and position of your pieces. You can only move your pieces to squares you can see. Both white and blacks officers are shuffled separately and completely random. Therefor you can't know where your opponents king is at the beginning of the game. You win SlugChess by capturing the opponents king. There are two sub-variants of SlugChess with different vision rules. They are <em>SlugChess Torch</em> and <em>SlugChess Sight</em>.

In <em>SlugChess Torch</em> the vision is a range around your pieces, as if they are holding a touch. The range of pawns are 1 and officers 2. This sub-variant results in methodical games where you have to fight for vision and build up and advantage.

In <em>SlugChess Sight</em> the vision is the squares your pieces can move to. Therefor your pieces can move as in normal chess but you can see a lot less. In addition knights and pawns have vision range of 1. This sub-variant results in dynamic and aggressive games that can swing back and fourth and can end quickly.§Version¥1.0.0‰¥AppId±com.snes9x.Snes9x¤Name¦Snes9x§Summary¹A Super Nintendo emulator­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/snes9x/Snes9x/f3817290a4e5ec502fac6f387e97a57c/icons/128x128/com.snes9x.Snes9x.pngÙuhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/snes9x/Snes9x/f3817290a4e5ec502fac6f387e97a57c/icons/128x128@2/com.snes9x.Snes9x.png«Screenshots“Ùlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/snes9x/Snes9x/f3817290a4e5ec502fac6f387e97a57c/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/snes9x/Snes9x/f3817290a4e5ec502fac6f387e97a57c/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/snes9x/Snes9x/f3817290a4e5ec502fac6f387e97a57c/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories­Game,Emulator¯RichDescriptionÚSnes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator.

Immerse yourself into your role, tinker with detailed systems, and survive the chaos in this round-based multiplayer role playing game.

Your duties guide you through rich interactions with complex mechanics, whether you're managing your inventory, setting up the reactor, or flushing yourself down the disposal tubes. 

 As disaster, incompetence, and sabotage strike the station, the tension rises - opening up emergent situations that force you to make hard choices. Will you patch up the medical bay after an asteroid punches a hole in it, or fight for control when the captain gets murdered by revolutionaries? Do you break out an unjustly imprisoned clown, or sit back at the bar and serve drinks without a care in the world? 

 The story of the station's collapse is in the hands of its players, and each round is an intense, immersive experience that will leave you wanting more.

Features:


Shows the unread email counter in the Thunderbird system tray icon.
Optionally can animate the Thunderbird system tray icon if new mail is received.
You can snooze new mail notifications for a specific time period.
Birdtray checks the unread e-mail status directly by reading the Thunderbird email search database. This means it does not need any extensions, and thus is immune to any future extension API changes in Thunderbird
It can hide the Thunderbird window, and restore it. There is also context menu for that.
You can configure which accounts you want to check for unread emails on
You can choose different font colors for different email accounts. This allows you, for example, to have blue unread count for personal emails, red unread count for work emails, and green unread count if both folders have unread mail.
Can launch Thunderbird when Birdtray starts, and terminate it when Birdtray quits (configurable).
Can monitor that Thunderbird is running, and indicate it if you accidentally closed it.
Has configurable "New Email" functionality, allowing pre-configured email templates.


The feature to "Start Thunderbird when Birdtray starts" needs the flathub thunderbird installed by default. The default thunderbird directory is "~/.var/app/org.mozilla.Thunderbird/.thunderbird".§Version¥1.9.0‰¥AppIdºcom.ultimaker.cura.desktop¤Name®UltiMaker Cura§SummaryÙ+Slicer to prepare your 3D printing projects­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù…https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/ultimaker/cura.desktop/34db8d248e1ad47e21cfee11c3ce1178/icons/128x128/com.ultimaker.cura.desktop.pngÙ‡https://dl.flathub.org/media/com/ultimaker/cura.desktop/34db8d248e1ad47e21cfee11c3ce1178/icons/128x128@2/com.ultimaker.cura.desktop.png«Screenshots‘Ùuhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/com/ultimaker/cura.desktop/34db8d248e1ad47e21cfee11c3ce1178/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÚ/UltiMaker Cura is a slicer, an application that prepares your model for 3D printing.

Davis was a very skilled and devote catholic programmer who sadly suffered from schizophrenia during his life, although this didn't stop Terry from becoming one of the most famous and recognisable figures of the general internet community gaining recognition from even Larry Page the co-founder of the Google search engine. What Terry managed to achieve in his life is sadly commonly undervalued and overlooked due to his schizophrenia; however what Terry managed to achieve in his programming ventures and his social media escapades, a small fragment of which considered controversial sadly given more attention than the greater body of his internet streams, truly is a remarkable feat even for an individual without mental health issues. That is to say that no one else to date has achieved the combined programming feats and social notoriety that Terry Davis, single-handedly, managed to achieve during his life. It is with great honour that I am able to write this passage about him.

<Writing is an essential part of our everyday life. Why make it complicated? Zettlr redefines what writing means. It is slim, fast, and versatile. Focus on what matters to you. Publish, not perish.

 In modern times, getting a hold of the flood of information is almost as hard as inserting a USB drive the right way on the first attempt. Zettlr allows you to connect pieces of information using state of the art Zettelkasten methodology. Links? Check. File IDs? Check. File tagging? Also check. And the best is: Unlike many competitors, Zettlr never locks you in. Zettlr supports almost every conceivable way to create links and identify your files. In other words: No matter where you come from â€” all ZettelkÃ¤sten are beautiful and supported by Zettlr. Out of the box.

 Zettlr integrates well with reference managers such as Zotero, JabRef, or Juris-M. Simply load your library into Zettlr, and begin to cite. Zettlr strictly adheres to established standards and does not reinvent the wheel. Citations can be loaded using CSL-JSON or BibTex and the citation processor only uses Citation Style Language, the de-facto industry standard for citations. This enables you to use one of over 9,000 different styles from the official Zotero repository!

 Due to its designing flexibility, Zettlr supports dark mode out of the box, as well as many different themes, suited to your needs. Switching is as easy as pressing a button. Not satisfied with the provided themes? No problem: Zettlr allows full customization of every single element; you can even create completely new themes using Custom CSS!

 No matter whether you work with a lot of notes, such as a Zettelkasten, or simply have a lot of files with different important contents: Zettlr's revolutionary heatmap search lets you find every single note you've ever written. No more confusion over where that one citation was!

 Twitter invented them and, since then, everybody adopted them: Hashtags! Zettlr goes one step further, not only allowing you to link and categorize your notes using tags, but using its tag-manager you can assign colors to tags to visualize your notes immediately!

 Zettlr scales well with your aspirations. From the first texts in university to your dissertation thesis: Using the advanced features of Zettlr tailored to researchers, journalists, and novelists writing whole books is as easy as creating a new project. Zettlr will never stand in your way, just like a good app should.

Petri nets are a well established means to describe concurrent systems. Over the years, numerous extensions to the basic formalism have been proposed to account for abstract data types, object-orientation, hierarchies or new arc types.

Among them is the reference nets formalism, where tokens can be references to arbitrary objects, especially other nets, thus allowing nested net models. It allows Java inscriptions, has built-in List and Tuple types, offers test, inhibitor and flexible arcs and has a powerful synchronization mechanism.§Version£4.1‰¥AppIdºde.rwth_aachen.ient.RDPlot¤Name¦RDPlot§SummaryÙ4RDPlot is a tool for plotting rate distortion curves­ContentRatingÚœviolence-cartoon:none,violence-fantasy:none,violence-realistic:none,violence-bloodshed:none,violence-sexual:none,drugs-alcohol:none,drugs-narcotics:none,drugs-tobacco:none,sex-nudity:none,sex-themes:none,language-profanity:none,language-humor:none,language-discrimination:none,social-chat:none,social-info:none,social-audio:none,social-location:none,social-contacts:none,money-purchasing:none,money-gambling:none¥IconsÀ«Screenshots‘Ùahttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/flathub/de.rwth_aachen.ient.RDPlot/master/RDPlot-screenshot.pngªCategories§Science¯RichDescriptionÙ™RD Plot is a plotting tool for visualizing rate-distortion data parsed from encoder log files of common video coding reference software packages.

 This is accomplished by means of file descriptor passing of the pseudo-terminal device from a small "agent" program running on the other side of a container boundary. The agent is started using the usual container tools (flatpak-spawn, toolbox, podman), but creating a session is done purely via sockets. 

 Boxi uses different application identifiers when it is run for different containers. This allows creating individual launcher icons for each container. §Version¡5‰¥AppId»dev.bragefuglseth.Fretboard¤Name©Fretboard§SummaryµLook up guitar chords­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù‡https://dl.flathub.org/media/dev/bragefuglseth/Fretboard/324e7499053334311e70eabff471fbe8/icons/128x128/dev.bragefuglseth.Fretboard.pngÙ‰https://dl.flathub.org/media/dev/bragefuglseth/Fretboard/324e7499053334311e70eabff471fbe8/icons/128x128@2/dev.bragefuglseth.Fretboard.png«Screenshots”Ùvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/dev/bragefuglseth/Fretboard/324e7499053334311e70eabff471fbe8/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/dev/bragefuglseth/Fretboard/324e7499053334311e70eabff471fbe8/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/dev/bragefuglseth/Fretboard/324e7499053334311e70eabff471fbe8/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/dev/bragefuglseth/Fretboard/324e7499053334311e70eabff471fbe8/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngªCategories©Education¯RichDescriptionÚXHow was that chord played, again?

Import local files or folders to workspaces, or convert one of your image folders to a workspace.
Create metadata groups, which are a collection of information such as author, copyright notice, description and notes, which can be directly injected into the EXIF metadata of the JPG images files during workspace operations.
Convert non-JPG images to JPG for EXIF support.
Add, edit, or remove image tags before workspace or online list operations.

 Unfortunately, the reality of being a knight isn't so glamorous. What's common sense for Oren is unthinkable for the knights, and he quickly finds himself tossed out onto the street after failing to adapt.

 Just when Oren thinks his life has hit rock bottom, an adventurer named Litia invites him to join her party. Knights and adventurers are usually mortal enemies, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and Oren isn't above swallowing his pride in order to survive.

 Oren and Litia bicker to no end. There seems to be very little the duo can agree on. But as a team, the two work together surprisingly well, and the work of an adventurer is nothing like what Oren had imagined.

 Given a glimpse of a different future, will Oren abandon his dream of becoming a knight and embrace his new life as an adventurer?§Version¥1.0.0‰¥AppIdÙ!games.zetsubou.HumanityMustPerish¤Name´Humanity Must Perish§SummaryÙiA comedic visual novel about an android dressed as a high school girl as she prepares to destroy humanity­ContentRating¯sex-themes:mild¥Icons‘Ù˜https://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.humanitymustperish/15fa17638407d0039aea2d3b17816d91/icons/128x128/games.zetsubou.HumanityMustPerish.png«Screenshots•Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.humanitymustperish/15fa17638407d0039aea2d3b17816d91/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.humanitymustperish/15fa17638407d0039aea2d3b17816d91/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.humanitymustperish/15fa17638407d0039aea2d3b17816d91/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.humanitymustperish/15fa17638407d0039aea2d3b17816d91/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.humanitymustperish/15fa17638407d0039aea2d3b17816d91/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngªCategories¤Game¯RichDescriptionÚ‡As an android whose sole purpose is to save planet Earth from destruction at the hands of mankind, Kyuu minces no words as she announces her plans to extinguish the human race.

 For the sake of preserving planet Earth, humanity must perish. Failing that, mankind must be enslaved. Those are the only two options, and if Kyuu has her way, the former will soon become a reality.

 Before she can do so, however, her creator makes a proposition: Kyuu will spend one day among regular, everyday human beings, judging for herself whether they are capable of meaningful change or not.

 Kyuu accepts this proposition, and thus sets out into the world for the first time, coming face to face with a variety of odd individuals as she decides the fate of mankind.

 Will Kyuu's colorful encounters show her the good in human society? Or will the bizarre antics of those who she meets reaffirm her belief that mankind must be destroyed?

 Whatever her decision may be, the impressions Kyuu leaves on those she meets won't soon be forgotten. She is a harsh critic, and for a race as flawed as mankind, her observations and misunderstandings will be boundless.§Version¥1.2.2‰¥AppIdºgames.zetsubou.MaxMassacre¤Name¬Max Massacre§SummaryÙ4A visual novel set in a monster-filled fantasy world­ContentRatingÙ%violence-fantasy:mild,sex-themes:mild¥Icons‘ÙŠhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.maxmassacre/4a17424adfdd03e917cd287563d92bce/icons/128x128/games.zetsubou.MaxMassacre.png«Screenshots•Ùzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.maxmassacre/4a17424adfdd03e917cd287563d92bce/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.maxmassacre/4a17424adfdd03e917cd287563d92bce/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.maxmassacre/4a17424adfdd03e917cd287563d92bce/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.maxmassacre/4a17424adfdd03e917cd287563d92bce/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.maxmassacre/4a17424adfdd03e917cd287563d92bce/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngªCategories¤Game¯RichDescriptionÚ	Max Massacre is a Visual Novel with a single choice to determine the ending.

 In a world filled with monsters, demons, and other inhuman creatures, mankind is no longer the dominant race. Humans are nothing more than cattle, fed on by more powerful entities and hunted down for sport. Humans in general are weak, not even a match for the children of those who hunt them, and they know it. The human race is steadily declining, and before long, mankind will exist no longer.

 As a child born into such a world, Max aspires to become a hero. A mighty warrior who will save the human race from the cusp of extinction, wielding strength unheard of for a boy on the brink of adulthood. He is already the strongest fighter in his village in hand to hand combat, and he has killed his fair share of low-level monsters. At seventeen years of age, he is well on his way to becoming the hero he aspires to be, and no matter how much his fellow villagers hate and scorn him for his demonic aura, Max wishes to save every one of them.

 Forever by Max's side is his childhood friend and love interest, Celeste. Like Max, she possesses incredible strength, and is by far the strongest sorceress in the village. She is knowledgeable, intelligent, well-liked, and quite attractive; a truly fortunate young woman in almost every way imaginable. However, beneath this amiable exterior is a mind far more cynical and unforgiving. She does not share Max's outlook on life, nor does she condone his desire to become a hero, or to protect those who harm him. To her, humans are no better than the demons oppressing them, and she would happily leave their village in flames, if only Max would go with her.

 As Max and Celeste go about their routine lives in the small village they call home, their differing views on the world clash every day, with each one trying to convince the other to see the light. But with the other villagers all living in fear and contempt of Max, and not hesitating for a moment to show how they feel, Celeste has a clear advantage. She believes it's only a matter of time before Max realizes what a fool he has been, and with the level of malice being directed towards Max increasing day by day, she might be right.

 Will Max manage to convince Celeste that the human race is worth protecting? Or will Celeste prove to Max once and for all that his enemy is not demonkind, but the familiar faces of those who deny his humanity?§Version¥2.0.0‰¥AppIdÙ!games.zetsubou.SablesGrimoireDemo¤Name·Sable's Grimoire (Demo)§SummaryÙ>Monster girl visual novel which takes place in a magic academy­ContentRating¿sex-nudity:mild,sex-themes:mild¥Icons‘Ù˜https://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.sablesgrimoiredemo/1d19f4e9e0c18da25022de5179f3cec9/icons/128x128/games.zetsubou.SablesGrimoireDemo.png«Screenshots•Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.sablesgrimoiredemo/1d19f4e9e0c18da25022de5179f3cec9/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.sablesgrimoiredemo/1d19f4e9e0c18da25022de5179f3cec9/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.sablesgrimoiredemo/1d19f4e9e0c18da25022de5179f3cec9/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.sablesgrimoiredemo/1d19f4e9e0c18da25022de5179f3cec9/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.sablesgrimoiredemo/1d19f4e9e0c18da25022de5179f3cec9/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngªCategories¤Game¯RichDescriptionÚdSable's Grimoire tells the story of an aspiring magic researcher who begins to attend an academy filled with demi-humans.

 When Sable is accepted into Amadronia Magic Academy, a prestigious academy famous for its resources and curriculum, he believes that he has crossed an important milestone in his life.

 As an aspiring magic researcher, not to mention one of the few pure-blooded human beings capable of using magic, Sable has high hopes for his time at Amadronia. His dream of becoming a world-renowned magic researcher is finally within his grasp, and with the assistance of the much-lauded teaching staff at Amadronia, he is sure that the next few years of his life will be as productive as they are enlightening.

 Unfortunately for Sable, his first day at Amadronia quickly proves to him that this will not be the case.

 Arrogant elves, a ravenous rokurokubi, a poison-tongued mandragora, a pyromaniac dragon, unenthusiastic teachers - Amadronia is nothing like Sable envisioned. The students in his class are unruly, his "teacher" has no interest in teaching, the principal willfully breaks academy rules, and it seems like everywhere he turns, Sable finds one more reason to doubt Amadronia's proud legacy.

 Will Sable manage to survive at this clearly dysfunctional academy? Or will he, like so many others, leave Amadronia feeling utterly disillusioned?§Version¥1.2.0‰¥AppId»games.zetsubou.WanderNoMore¤Name®Wander No More§SummaryÙ3A visual novel telling the story of a rogue samurai­ContentRatingÙ¶violence-realistic:none,violence-bloodshed:mild,violence-sexual:none,drugs-alcohol:none,drugs-tobacco:none,sex-nudity:none,sex-themes:none,sex-appearance:none,language-profanity:mild¥Icons‘ÙŒhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.wandernomore/3a991e5bab324746c6185c6bc4e1caf8/icons/128x128/games.zetsubou.WanderNoMore.png«Screenshots”Ù{https://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.wandernomore/3a991e5bab324746c6185c6bc4e1caf8/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙ{https://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.wandernomore/3a991e5bab324746c6185c6bc4e1caf8/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙ{https://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.wandernomore/3a991e5bab324746c6185c6bc4e1caf8/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙ{https://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/games.zetsubou.wandernomore/3a991e5bab324746c6185c6bc4e1caf8/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngªCategories¤Game¯RichDescriptionÚWhen Kouichirou Nabatame finally worked up the courage to desert his kingdom, he thought his days of bloodshed were behind him. He believed that if he ran far enough, and for long enough, he could leave it all behind. A normal life would finally be his, and he would be able to spend his days peacefully, helping others and protecting their happiness, rather than destroying them without mercy.

 But as Kouichirou knew deep inside his heart, peace would not be his so easily.

 After weeks on the run, Kouichirou passed through Hotsu Village, and the moment he did, he spelled its demise. The Kodokushi, an elite band of samurai he used to lead, slaughtered the village's residents, then set it ablaze and continued their search.

 Powerless to stop them, Kouichirou emerged after his former subordinates moved on, desperate to put out the flames and find himself food and shelter. He moved from house to house, searching for anything edible, until he at last stumbled upon a storeroom, in which he found... a girl.

 Orphaned, maimed, and robbed of her village, the girl would undoubtedly die a slow, painful death. Kouichirou knew this, and thus asked the girl a simple question.

 "Do you want to live?"

 But as he prepared to put the girl out of her misery, a fire lit in her eyes. Before she could vocalize her response, the girl, Chiyo, had already conveyed her answer.

 "Then as the one responsible for all of this, it is my duty to make sure that happens. My name is Kouichirou Nabatame, and from this day onward, Chiyo, you are my daughter."§Version£1.2‰¥AppId¶garden.jamie.Morphosis¤Name©Morphosis§Summary¶Convert your documents­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù‚https://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/garden.jamie.morphosis/eca8ef0a1f55c6b98d2b1a68c29d5303/icons/128x128/garden.jamie.Morphosis.pngÙ„https://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/garden.jamie.morphosis/eca8ef0a1f55c6b98d2b1a68c29d5303/icons/128x128@2/garden.jamie.Morphosis.png«Screenshots‘Ùvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/g/ga/garden.jamie.morphosis/eca8ef0a1f55c6b98d2b1a68c29d5303/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÚUse Morphosis to easily convert your text documents to other formats.

The Total Annihilation Inspired RTS you've been waiting for.

 Explore the Scale and Realism:

 All units and projectiles are simulated in real-time. The game offers fully simulated projectile ballistics, explosion physics and terrain deformation. Enjoy an immersive RTS experience, whether you are commanding individual units, or armies of thousands. Take control as you engage in an epic struggle for domination! 

 Strategic Importance of Terrain:

 The shape of every battlefield in-game imposes which strategies work and which units are effective to use. No two maps will play the same. Every terrain has a unit to match. Nuclear warfare can redefine the rules of the game. Utilize over 10 different unit classes, including giant Experimental units, to work your way to victory. 

 Infinite Possible Strategies:

 Beyond All Reason doesn't limit you in terms of resources or the size of your army. Want to humiliate your enemies by disarming them within a few precise early strikes? No problem. Prefer to build up and obliterate them with a thousand bombers? We got you covered! Immerse yourself in a world where the only real limitation to the scale of the battle is what your CPU can handle! 

 400+ Units Unique and with a Purpose:

 Each and every unit in the game has a role to fill. Mix-and-match units to create infinite possible tactics. Experiment with your own combinations and show off the new strategies you develop in battle.§Versionª1.2988.0.1‰¥AppIdÙ info.bibletime.BibleTime.desktop¤Name©BibleTime§Summary³Bible Study Program­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù‘https://dl.flathub.org/media/info/bibletime/BibleTime.desktop/6529e05dc9bd7adff301e0098fbe5d76/icons/128x128/info.bibletime.BibleTime.desktop.pngÙ“https://dl.flathub.org/media/info/bibletime/BibleTime.desktop/6529e05dc9bd7adff301e0098fbe5d76/icons/128x128@2/info.bibletime.BibleTime.desktop.png«Screenshots’Ù{https://dl.flathub.org/media/info/bibletime/BibleTime.desktop/6529e05dc9bd7adff301e0098fbe5d76/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙ{https://dl.flathub.org/media/info/bibletime/BibleTime.desktop/6529e05dc9bd7adff301e0098fbe5d76/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngªCategories¿Literature,Education,Dictionary¯RichDescriptionÙáBibleTime is a completely free Bible study program, built for Linux, Windows, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.

This is the final release, and is not maintained. 

 IMPORTANT: Running Pd-extended under Flatpak is experimental. The following are known limitations. 

 
Realtime priority cannot be used. 
JACK audio backend cannot be used. 
 

 Packages from puredata.info do not have these limitations. 

 Pure Data is an open source visual programming environment that runs on anything from personal computers to embedded devices (ie Raspberry Pi) and smartphones (via libpd, DroidParty (Android), and PdParty (iOS). It is a major branch of the family of patcher programming languages known as Max (Max/FTS, ISPW Max, Max/MSP, etc), originally developed by Miller Puckette at IRCAM. 

 Pd enables musicians, visual artists, performers, researchers, and developers to create software graphically without writing lines of code. Pd can be used to process and generate sound, video, 2D/3D graphics, and interface sensors, input devices, and MIDI. Pd can easily work over local and remote networks to integrate wearable technology, motor systems, lighting rigs, and other equipment. It is suitable for learning basic multimedia processing and visual programming methods as well as for realizing complex systems for large-scale projects. §Version¦0.44.0‰¥AppId°info.puredata.Pd¤Name®Pure Data (Pd)§Summary¾realtime computer music system­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/info/puredata/Pd/6c5b2f3c33b205bf7d59c3d158421a9c/icons/128x128/info.puredata.Pd.pngÙshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/info/puredata/Pd/6c5b2f3c33b205bf7d59c3d158421a9c/icons/128x128@2/info.puredata.Pd.png«Screenshots‘Ùkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/info/puredata/Pd/6c5b2f3c33b205bf7d59c3d158421a9c/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategoriesÙ+Audio,AudioVideo,Development,Music,Graphics¯RichDescriptionÚzPure Data (or just "Pd") is an open source visual programming language for multimedia.

It is an alpha version and there are still some parts which do not work for one reason or another, but in general the Flatpak seems to be in a working state. Adding mods, checking for updates, selecting mods for your mod list, and updating your profiles works.

Feel free to test it and give me a report on how well it works for you. First, read the instructions on the homepage on how to use the Flatpak. Direct all issues and bug reports to the issues there. It should be safe to use, but there are no guarantees. The version is still a testing alpha version. I would highly appreciate it if some of you could give it a try (any Linux users, especially those on Steam Deck, and anyone else with Flatpak support on their system) and report back what are the results.

Stardrop is an open-source, cross-platform mod manager for the game Stardew Valley. It is built using the Avalonia UI framework.

Stardrop utilizes SMAPI (Stardew Modding API) to simplify the management and update checking for all applicable Stardew Valley mods. Stardrop is also non-destructive due to how it integrates with SMAPI, meaning it can be uninstalled without any impact on SMAPI, Stardew Valley or the user&amp;apos;s original mod folder.

Supports both CUDA and CPU calculations. Its purpose and goals are: 

 
Easily-extensible database of materials 
Multiple physical models, including the unidirectional nonlinear wave equation and finite-difference time-domain approaches. 
Efficient code so that complicated systems can be simulated in 3D: Real laser pulses can be messy, and if they weren't so before a nonlinear crystal, there's a good chance they are after. Multidimensional simulations open up the weird world of spatiotemporal couplings. You have options for very fast simulations when there's a symmetry to use (e.g. cylindrical), alongside fully 3D propagation 
A graphical interface that lets you see what you're doing 
A flexible sequence mode to string together elements: not just nonlinear crystals, also spherical or parabolic mirrors, apertures, filters, free space propagation and more

It was released in 2016 by DoctorM64 and his team, and very soon after, has received a DMCA letter from Nintendo. A few years after, multiple members of the community managed to reverse engineer the game and published unofficial updates, dubbed the AM2R-Community-Updates. Those fixed bugs and added new features like widescreen, added content planned by the original devs before they were struck down, and ported it to other platforms.

The AM2RLauncher lets you conveniently play those Community-Updates, automatically receive updates, install AM2R mods and create APKs to play on your phone. No copyrighted files are shipped, you need to provide your own copy of AM2R_11!

What distinguishes this solution from others, is emphasis on low-latency to provide the best drawing experience.

 The Android app itself can be found on the github repo at github.com/androidvirtualpen/virtualpen/releases/download/0.1/virtual-pen.apk and soon on the Google Play Store if you wish to support further development.

 Features

 
Adjustable pen pressure threshold such that you can move the pen-cursor without triggering an unintended click/draw action 
Adjustable pen pressure sensitivity such that you can customize the force needed to be applied 
Eraser support 
Switch between stretched and fixed display mode. In stretched mode, the android device screen is stretched and completely mapped to your PC primary screen. Note that this is required to fully reach the boundaries of your PC screen from your device but causes some slight distortion if the screen ratios (android vs PC) are not the same. In fixed mode, if the android device screen resolution fits into your PC screen, the android device display is centered and mapped on the host at a 1:1 ratio. This mode should incurr no distortion. 
Detects available usb devices and automatically save your settings for each 
Supports both X11 and Wayland 
 

Usage

 Start the android application connected to your PC through usb. It should warn that the link with the PC is not yet established. For the link to be fully establish, you need to start the virtual-pen app on your PC which will set your device in accessory mode. On the linux host, launch the Virtual Pen application, select your device (hit refresh if not shown) then enter the device's screen horizontal and vertical resolutions and then press "connect". Upon the first connection, Android should ask you to allow the Virtual Pen app to handle the connection - press ok. Once this done, you should be able to use your pen and see your PC cursor move as intended. Note that this software is still in beta stage and still ought to be tested with various devices.§Version¥0.0.1‰¥AppId¿io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox¤NameªAntiMicroX§SummaryÙTGraphical program used to map gamepad buttons to keyboard, mouse, scripts and macros­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/antimicrox.antimicrox/eadfd46316003cf932be0b8a99f8d1da/icons/128x128/io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox.pngÙ‘https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/antimicrox.antimicrox/eadfd46316003cf932be0b8a99f8d1da/icons/128x128@2/io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox.png«Screenshots–Ùzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/antimicrox.antimicrox/eadfd46316003cf932be0b8a99f8d1da/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/antimicrox.antimicrox/eadfd46316003cf932be0b8a99f8d1da/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/antimicrox.antimicrox/eadfd46316003cf932be0b8a99f8d1da/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/antimicrox.antimicrox/eadfd46316003cf932be0b8a99f8d1da/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/antimicrox.antimicrox/eadfd46316003cf932be0b8a99f8d1da/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/antimicrox.antimicrox/eadfd46316003cf932be0b8a99f8d1da/screenshots/image-6_orig.pngªCategoriesªUtility,Qt¯RichDescriptionÚMAntiMicroX is a graphical program used to map gamepad buttons/joysticks to keyboard, mouse, scripts and macros.

This is especially inefficient when the sections are far apart. 

 Jumpdf solves this by having multiple marks/cursors one can switch between. Instead of scrolling, one can create a new mark at the desired location and jump back and forth. In addition, the marks are grouped into groups, which one can also switch between, enabling one to maintain different sets of related marks. For example, in a textbook, one can have a group with marks for the exercises and solutions and another group for reading the material relevant to the exercises. Having these groups also enables one to have a separate window for each group. 

 Existing PDF viewers like sioyek and zathura also have marks. However, their marks only record locations, whereas in jumpdf, the current mark follows the current cursor, functioning more like tabs. This allows for maintaining multiple views of the document without having to manually reset the marks.

It provides an easy way to record videos from Miniscopes, create Z-stacks to give an overview of visible cells or tissue features and provides an online background subtraction feature to gain an initial insight into cellular calcium activity while data is recorded. Recorded data is encoded with the FFV1 codec by default, to allow for smaller, lossless video files that are safe to archive. 

 The software is designed to work with the latest OpenCV libraries and provides a shared library, so Miniscope recording features can easily be embedded into other programs and pipelines. PoMiDAQ will work with Miniscope V3, V4 and the Siminiscope hardware using the standard DAQ box v3.2. §Version¥0.5.2‰¥AppIdÙ#io.github.brainstormtrooper.facteur¤Name§Facteur§SummaryÙ3Sends template-based emails to a list of recipients­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù—https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/icons/128x128/io.github.brainstormtrooper.facteur.pngÙ™https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/icons/128x128@2/io.github.brainstormtrooper.facteur.png«Screenshots—Ù~https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙ~https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙ~https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙ~https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙ~https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngÙ~https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/screenshots/image-6_orig.pngÙ~https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/brainstormtrooper.facteur/d4b7d6c05ed84c23d7002e242d2c46ba/screenshots/image-7_orig.pngªCategories¬Office,Email¯RichDescriptionÙƒA GTK mail-merge emailing app for small business offering:

Open Cloud Saves is available for use officially as a â€œbetaâ€. As a beta test, we recommend that you manually make a backup of your save data before usage. Until Open Cloud Save is more battle tested, we will issue a warning for users to use caution with â€œcritical, belovedâ€ save data.

Open Cloud Save gives an advantage over existing cloud solutions:

1. Allows cloud saves for games without developer support 2. Allows for the exclusion of certain files or filetypes. This can prevent games syncing graphical settings in addition to syncing save data. 3. Allows for sync between storefronts - you own a Steam on linux and a Epic Game Store version on windows

Key Features:

1. Inclusion of specific save files based on [pattern matching](https://rclone.org/filtering/) 2. Customizable save data locations - you can tailor the app to your specific save locations 3. Ability to create new save definitions - you do not need to wait for developers to support cloud saves for their games. 4. Data protection - by default, OpenCloudSave will perform a dry-run before all syncs. This way you can see what changes will be made to your save data before they happen. (You can disable this functionality if you just want to immediately sync)§Version¦0.18.1‰¥AppIdÙ&io.github.davidoc26.wallpaper_selector¤Name²Wallpaper Selector§SummaryÙ Downloads and applies wallpapers­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots‘Ùnhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Davidoc26/wallpaper-selector/main/data/resources/screenshots/screenshot1.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÙ@Simple application to download and set wallpapers from wallhaven§Version¥0.3.3‰¥AppId¹io.github.dbchoco.Salawat¤Name§Salawat§SummaryÙ Islamic prayer times application­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots’ÙJhttps://github.com/DBChoco/Salawat/blob/main/images/lightMain.png?raw=trueÙNhttps://github.com/DBChoco/Salawat/blob/main/images/lightSettings.png?raw=trueªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÚİIslamic prayer times (Adhan) that is highly customizable, lightweight and open source.

The Rebirth Team has spent a lot of time working to improve the source code by fixing old bugs and adding some improvements, while always staying true to our philosophy: Keep it Descent! 

 DXX-Rebirth has every little feature you may remember from the original Descent 1 & 2 and much more. For example:

 
Full compatibility with Descent and Descent 2, including all expansions and third-party levels. 
DXX-Rebirth runs on your favourite Operating System. We officially support Linux (and other *NIXs), Mac OS X and Windows. The source code can also be compiled on many other systems! 
OpenGL provides fast and smooth rendering - even on low-end systems. 
Optionally you can enable several effects like Transparency, Colored Lighting, Texture Filtering, FSAA, etc. 
Thanks to SDL, a wide variety of Joysticks are supported. Also you can use more Joysticks, buttons and axes than you can ever operate in your state of evolution. 
Joystick, Keyboard and Mouse can be used simultaneously. 
The games can display all resolutions and aspects supported by your monitor, including an option for VSync. 
Besides MIDI and CD-Audio (Redbook), you can play your own custom Music from your hard drive or a separate AddOn. 
Both games can utilize special AddOn packs to replace or expand the original game content. 
Multiplayer via UDP protocol provides a fast and easy-to-use LAN and Online action. This includes reliable communication causing less glitches due to lost packets. 
The ingame Demo-recording system has been improved. Demos are less glitchy and smaller while still still being backwards-compatible to earlier versions of the games. 
Higher game speed will not cause glitches such as unacceptable fast homing projectiles, incredible high damage caused by several collisions or Fusion cannon, etc. 
Player files, Savegames, Demos and Missions from DOS-Versions of the games can freely be used in DXX-Rebirth and vice versa. 
Mac Command keys are now working - see F1 Help. Command-Q works much like a normal Mac program 
Multiplayer support over UDP/IP (using port 42424 by default) 
Even more ...

Score frags to win the game using a balanced set of weapons each designed for different situations. Guns include a chaingun, rocket launcher, shotgun, and railgun. 

 OpenArena's style of play is very fast and requires skill to be played successfully online. Gameplay modes include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Tournament, Capture the Flag, Elimination, CTF Elimination, Last Man Standing and Double Domination. 

 This version of OpenArena is based on the Quake3e engine, we do not take credit for the work done by the OpenArena team nor "Eugene", who develops the Quake3e engine. This Flatpak was made to be a replacement of the original one released in 2012, as it contains bugs and annoyances not present in this engine. 

 A configuration file is also available, which lets you modify CVARS however you want. The OAX patch has been applied, which adds support for more screen resolutions and makes the game playable in many modern systems, it also includes bugfixes and improvements. (to disable this patch modify the config file). Beware that trying to connect to an OAX-patched server may not work with unpatched clients.

Unlike other source ports, the goal is to preserve the original look, feel, limitations, and bugs of the original DOS executable. 

 Full support for single- and multi-player games is provided, for all of the original Doom games, Chex Quest, and Hacx. Unlike the original executable, network play is implemented on the IP network stack, allowing it to function on modern LANs and the Internet. 

 The easiest way to run Crispy Doom is to copy a supported game file (known as a "WAD") to the root of your home directory and launch the application. If you have trouble with the automatic game file detection or need to manage multiple WAD files, you can run the application from the command line with a path to the selected game file:

Flatsweep helps you easily get rid of the residue left on your system by uninstalled Flatpaks. 

 Flatsweep uses GTK4 and Libadwaita to provide a coherent user interface that integrates nicely with GNOME, but you can use it on any desktop environment of course. 

 Caution: Flatsweep exclusively looks at the default Flatpak install directory. If you have set a custom install path, it might accidentally delete files that weren't supposed to be deleted. If you have no idea what a 'custom install path' is, you'll be fine. §Versionªv2024.3.20‰¥AppId¿io.github.giantpinkrobots.varia¤Name¥Varia§Summary»Download files and torrents­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/giantpinkrobots.varia/cef942b2ba82c1bc38ede03896c43fb5/icons/128x128/io.github.giantpinkrobots.varia.pngÙ‘https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/giantpinkrobots.varia/cef942b2ba82c1bc38ede03896c43fb5/icons/128x128@2/io.github.giantpinkrobots.varia.png«Screenshots•Ùzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/giantpinkrobots.varia/cef942b2ba82c1bc38ede03896c43fb5/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/giantpinkrobots.varia/cef942b2ba82c1bc38ede03896c43fb5/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/giantpinkrobots.varia/cef942b2ba82c1bc38ede03896c43fb5/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/giantpinkrobots.varia/cef942b2ba82c1bc38ede03896c43fb5/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/giantpinkrobots.varia/cef942b2ba82c1bc38ede03896c43fb5/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngªCategories§Network¯RichDescriptionÚWVaria is a download manager for all your download needs.

Its primary functions are to allow editing map tiles, collision, events, connections, and properties. Porymap provides additional functionality, such as tileset editing and region map editing.

 Those familiar with traditional Gen 3 binary ROM hacking can think of it as the Advance Map equivalent for the decompilation projects. Porymap supports the same features as Advance Map, so Advance Map users shouldnâ€™t have much difficulty learning how to use Porymap. There are many usability improvements in Porymap. The most notable is undo/redo when painting map tiles.

 Porymap reads and writes files in the decompilation projects. It does not read or write ROM files. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use Git for version control when working with Porymap.§Version¥5.4.1‰¥AppId¿io.github.hurricangame.hurrican¤Name¨Hurrican§SummaryÙ1Freeware jump and shoot game created by Poke53280­ContentRatingÙ5violence-fantasy:moderate,language-profanity:moderate¥IconsÀ«Screenshots‘Ù?https://github.com/HurricanGame/Hurrican/wiki/images/level1.pngªCategories¤Game¯RichDescriptionÙ1Freeware jump and shoot game created by Poke53280§Version¥1.0.1‰¥AppId¾io.github.hvdwofl.jExifToolGUI¤Name¬jExifToolGUI§SummaryÙ Simple frontend for the ExifTool­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots“Ù@https://hvdwolf.github.io/jExifToolGUI/screenshots/ExtraMenu.pngÙKhttps://hvdwolf.github.io/jExifToolGUI/screenshots/LinuxGeotagging-x600.jpgÙLhttps://hvdwolf.github.io/jExifToolGUI/screenshots/Linux-LXDE-mainscreen.jpgªCategories¨Graphics¯RichDescriptionÚrjExifToolGUI is a java/Swing Windows/Linux/MacOS graphical frontend for the excellent command-line application called ExifTool by Phil Harvey.

ExifTool is a platform-independent Perl command-line application and library for reading, writing and editing meta information in a wide variety of files. Exiftool is by far the best and most extensive metadata tool available! It reads and writes metadata information from/to many files, but primarily focuses on photos/images. It reads/writes exif, gps, xmp, maker notes for many cameras, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix and many, many more tags. It can use a "reference" image to write the tags to a multiple set of photos or a complete directory containing photos. Author/creator/maintainer of ExifTool: Phil Harvey.

jExifToolGui is a java/Swing program that functions as a graphical frontend (GUI) for exiftool. Many thanks go to Phil Harvey for his excellent tool. Without ExifTool, this jExifToolGui Graphical frontend for ExifTool would never have existed.

jExifToolGui is (just) a graphical frontend for ExifTool. It can use a "reference" image to write the tags to a multiple set of photos, like gps tags for photos that were taken at the same location but somehow miss or contain the incorrect gps info. jExifToolGUI also contains extensive renaming functionality based on the exif info in your photos.

It organises your files into an internal database and browses them with tags instead of folders, a little like a booru on your desktop. Tags and files can be anonymously shared through custom servers that any user may run. Everything is free, nothing phones home, and the source code is included with the release. It is developed mostly for Windows, but builds for Linux and macOS are available (perhaps with some limitations, depending on your situation).

 Currently importable filetypes are:

 
images - jpg, gif (including animated), png (including animated!), tiff, webp, bmp 
video - webm, mp4, mpeg, avi, mov, mkv, flv, wmv 
audio - mp3, flac, ogg, wma 
misc - swf, pdf, psd, zip, rar, 7z 
 

The client can download files and parse tags from a number of websites, including by default:

 
various imageboards, with a thread watcher 
the popular boorus 
gallery sites like deviant art, and pixiv 
tumblr and twitter 
 

And can be extended to download from more locations using easily shareable user-made downloaders. It can also be set to 'subscribe' to any gallery search, repeating it every few days to keep up with new results.

 The program's emphasis is on your freedom. There is no DRM, no spying, no censorship. The program never phones home.§Version£595‰¥AppIdµio.github.hypengw.Qcm¤Name£Qcm§Summary¼Material3 cloud music player­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù{https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/hypengw.Qcm/889ebccda52a386b22abf15e1d4d6be2/icons/128x128/io.github.hypengw.Qcm.pngÙ}https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/hypengw.Qcm/889ebccda52a386b22abf15e1d4d6be2/icons/128x128@2/io.github.hypengw.Qcm.png«Screenshots’Ùphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/hypengw.Qcm/889ebccda52a386b22abf15e1d4d6be2/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/hypengw.Qcm/889ebccda52a386b22abf15e1d4d6be2/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngªCategories¥Audio¯RichDescriptionÙjMaterial3 cloud music player

It aims at finding citations of the Septuagint in the Greek New Testament in a mechanical way. 

 The Bible, a book that has been translated into many languages, is maybe the most important book has ever existed. Believers have evidence that it is God's word, written by various people being inspired by God himself. 

 The Bible has many internal references. Many of them connect the two parts of the Bible: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The books of the Old Testament are usually written in Hebrew, while the books of the New Testament are Greek. A natural question can arise: How can Hebrew texts be cited in the Greek text? 

 There are several research projects on this, and today it seems to be clear that many authors of the New Testament cited a Greek translation of the Hebrew text, namely the Septuagint, that was widely popular in the first centuries, and still popular in some Christian churches. Many Bible translations, however, mostly use only the Hebrew text as a basis of the Old Testament, because the importance of the Septuagint is not yet widely identified. 

 This software project attempts to support finding citations of the Septuagint in the New Testament automatically. The work is based on The SWORD Project. 

 The bibref package offers several tools that help in comparing the verses of the Septuagint with the verses of the Greek New Testament. The tools consider the texts of full books of the Bible as one unit instead of considering just separated verses. The texts are provided by the SWORD project from the modules LXX and SBLGNT. In the newest versions the module StatResGNT is also supported. §Version©2024Sep26‰¥AppId½io.github.kriptolix.Poliedros¤Name©Poliedros§SummaryÙ&Poliedros is a multi-type dice roller.­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù‹https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/kriptolix.Poliedros/1e324667ac4e20497e101faa0dea604d/icons/128x128/io.github.kriptolix.Poliedros.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/kriptolix.Poliedros/1e324667ac4e20497e101faa0dea604d/icons/128x128@2/io.github.kriptolix.Poliedros.png«Screenshots”Ùxhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/kriptolix.Poliedros/1e324667ac4e20497e101faa0dea604d/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙxhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/kriptolix.Poliedros/1e324667ac4e20497e101faa0dea604d/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙxhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/kriptolix.Poliedros/1e324667ac4e20497e101faa0dea604d/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙxhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/kriptolix.Poliedros/1e324667ac4e20497e101faa0dea604d/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÙ©Poliedros is a multi-type dice roller.

It includes RAW processing and editing. Rather than using layers in the way that other photo editors do, LightZone lets the user build up a stack of tools which can be rearranged, readjusted, turned off and on, and removed from the stack. It's a completely non-destructive editor, where any of the tools can be re-adjusted or modified later â€” even in a different editing session. A tool stack can even be copied to a batch of photos at one time. LightZone always operates in a 16-bit linear color space with the wide gamut of ProPhoto RGB. §Version¥4.2.5‰¥AppIdÙ#io.github.kukuruzka165.materialgram¤Name¬materialgram§Summary²Googlized Telegram­ContentRatingÚ\violence-cartoon:none,violence-fantasy:none,violence-realistic:none,violence-bloodshed:none,violence-sexual:none,violence-desecration:none,violence-slavery:none,violence-worship:none,drugs-alcohol:none,drugs-narcotics:none,drugs-tobacco:none,sex-nudity:none,sex-themes:none,sex-homosexuality:none,sex-prostitution:none,sex-adultery:none,sex-appearance:none,language-profanity:none,language-humor:none,language-discrimination:none,social-chat:intense,social-info:none,social-audio:intense,social-location:none,social-contacts:intense,money-purchasing:intense,money-gambling:none,money-advertising:moderate¥Icons‘Ù—https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/kukuruzka165.materialgram/e9f4ed7636f0c63382cdc5a3ef9ad82b/icons/128x128/io.github.kukuruzka165.materialgram.png«Screenshots‘Ù~https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/kukuruzka165.materialgram/e9f4ed7636f0c63382cdc5a3ef9ad82b/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories¸Network,InstantMessaging¯RichDescriptionÙMTelegram Desktop based messenger with Material Design and additional features§Version§5.8.1.1‰¥AppId¼io.github.labbots.NiimPrintX¤NameªNiimPrintX§SummaryÙ+Create and print labels on Niimbot printers­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ù‰https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/labbots.NiimPrintX/512dadf4fa9dccc72dcc3888b1448f06/icons/128x128/io.github.labbots.NiimPrintX.png«Screenshots‘Ùwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/labbots.NiimPrintX/512dadf4fa9dccc72dcc3888b1448f06/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories¦Office¯RichDescriptionÙdNiimPrintX is an application to design and print labels using NiimBot label printers via Bluetooth. §Version¦0.0.47‰¥AppId½io.github.labsquare.CutePeaks¤Name©CutePeaks§Summary¾Standalone Sanger trace viewer­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ù‹https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/labsquare.CutePeaks/a80b4b03b170377a3484a26425ddbc70/icons/128x128/io.github.labsquare.CutePeaks.png«Screenshots‘Ùxhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/labsquare.CutePeaks/a80b4b03b170377a3484a26425ddbc70/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories¯Science,Biology¯RichDescriptionÙ A simple viewer for Sanger trace file.

It must be paired with a compatible engine to be played.

 There is a massive back catalogue, spanning over two decades, containing thousands of Quake levels and other modifications (â€œmodsâ€) made by fans of the game. LibreQuake aims to be compatible with these and allows most to be played without the need to use non-free software.

 To install mods for the flatpak version of LibreQuake you need to place them in the ~/.var/app/io.github.lavenderdotpet.LibreQuake/.quakespasm/ directory. This is were your config, screenshots and demos are located too.

 Disclaimer: In its current form LibreQuake is a work in progress effort which may include placeholder assets, missing textures or unfinished parts.

 Settings and their values are a 1:1 match with Pit House. This makes it possible to use presets shared by the community. The table of supported settings compared to Pit House can be found on the project website. This project has no official ties to Moza and/or their software. It's 100% independent work based largely on hours of reverse engineering the protocol. 

 Boxflat supports saving/loading presets and automatic per-game application. 

 If a device misses an axis an/or a button, an automatic game detection fix will be applied. No need for other software/SDL hints to make them work. 

 Supported devices: 

 
Wheelbases 
Wheels 
Pedals 
Handbrake 
Sequential shifter 
H-Pattern shifter 
E-Stop

 Note: The udev rules found in the GitHub repository need to be installed for the application to work properly.

Useful for finding time to speak someone or work on a project. Do note that the app requires that your school uses Zermelo to schedule, and you need access to it. Sticky Hours is an unofficial app using the Zermelo api and not associated with Zermelo. 

 For help with logging in, please take a look at the faq on the website. 

 The app uses GTK for the ui, so you can apply any GTK theme to the app. To do that you will need to allow the flatpak to access the GTK themes folder. The GTK themes folder is ~/.themes for user installed themes, or xdg-config/gtk-3.0 for package installed themes. This value will be referenced as INSERT_GTK_THEMES_FOLDER later on. If you installed the flatpak system-wide, run the following command: sudo flatpak override --filesystem=INSERT_GTK_THEMES_FOLDER If installed Sticky Hours for only one user, run flatpak override --user --filesystem=INSERT_GTK_THEMES_FOLDER §Version¥1.1.2‰¥AppId·io.github.mrvladus.List¤Name§Errands§Summary±Manage your tasks­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/mrvladus.List/128dd38fe4a3ebae99e787c8f349acb5/icons/128x128/io.github.mrvladus.List.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/mrvladus.List/128dd38fe4a3ebae99e787c8f349acb5/icons/128x128@2/io.github.mrvladus.List.png«Screenshots‘Ùrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/mrvladus.List/128dd38fe4a3ebae99e787c8f349acb5/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÚ7Todo application for those who prefer simplicity.

With this easy-to-use tool, users can interactively construct neuronal networks and explore network dynamics. 

 Advanced users often choose NEST Simulator: a prominent tool for spiking neuronal networks to measure network dynamics.However, programming knowledge is required to write code for this tool. NEST Desktop bypasses this requirement, but still teaches users how to construct and explore neuronal networks. A textual script is generated from the constructed networks and sent to NEST Simulator; the network activity is then visualized in a graph or table. It is a useful teaching tool, since the network graphs and network activity visualizations can be exported to files that users can implement for their course protocol. §Version¥4.0.2‰¥AppId¹io.github.nokse22.Exhibit¤Name§Exhibit§Summary¶Preview your 3D models­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùƒhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/icons/128x128/io.github.nokse22.Exhibit.pngÙ…https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/icons/128x128@2/io.github.nokse22.Exhibit.png«Screenshots—Ùthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/screenshots/image-6_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/nokse22.Exhibit/3ad70ef93ced3e563ad779ac789b9ca2/screenshots/image-7_orig.pngªCategoriesÙ"Graphics,Science,3DGraphics,Viewer¯RichDescriptionÚØBased on the F3D library, it supports many file formats, from digital content to scientific datasets including glTF, STL, STEP, PLY, OBJ, FBX, USD, Alembic and many more.

It connects to a reflector server and sends and receives audio encoded in Codec2 or AMBE. It also displays information about the users and modules connected to the reflector.

 Some modes may require an external vocoder plugin that can be downloaded from a URL, which will place the vocoder into the correct location for the platform. Add a full http url, including the filename, to the Vocoder URL option on the Settings tab, and click the Download vocoder button.

 For Android and iOS devices, the vocoder URL download method is the only way to load a vocoder plugin. For Linux, a vocoder can also be placed manually.

 To do this, copy the plugin to the system settings file location. On Linux, this is ~/.var/app/io.github.nostar.DroidStar/config/dudetronics - it is the same place where the host and id files are located (DMRHosts.txt, DMRIDs.data, etc).

 The vocoder plugin filename must be named vocoder_plugin.platform.arch where platform should be linux and arch can be x86_64 or arm64 depending on your system. The arch for your device is identified on the About tab.

 As the game progresses, more enemy types will be introduced and game mechanics may even change. However, when you die, your score is logged and all progress is reset! 

 Lastly, this game is fully free-and-open-source, in both meanings of free! Not only are all the assets public domain with CC-0 licenses, but the game itself is licensed under the GNU GPL v3, meaning you're free to modify and help improve the source code of the game.

While Pd-L2Ork is backwards compatible with Pure Data and other variants, the same is not true the other way around. Hence, some of the most advanced content created in Pd-L2Ork may not run well, or at all on other Pure Data variants. Pd-L2Ork is a brainchild of the Virginia Tech Linux Laptop Orchestra (L2Ork). 

 Pure Data is an open source visual programming environment that runs on anything from personal computers to embedded devices (ie Raspberry Pi) and smartphones (via libpd, DroidParty (Android), and PdParty (iOS). It is a major branch of the family of patcher programming languages known as Max (Max/FTS, ISPW Max, Max/MSP, etc), originally developed by Miller Puckette at IRCAM. 

 Pd enables musicians, visual artists, performers, researchers, and developers to create software graphically without writing lines of code. Pd can be used to process and generate sound, video, 2D/3D graphics, and interface sensors, input devices, and MIDI. Pd can easily work over local and remote networks to integrate wearable technology, motor systems, lighting rigs, and other equipment. It is suitable for learning basic multimedia processing and visual programming methods as well as for realizing complex systems for large-scale projects. §Version¨20241111‰¥AppId·io.github.peazip.PeaZip¤Name¦PeaZip§SummaryºFree file archiver utility­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/peazip.PeaZip/a86f5e81d9fe5080b090d1f82fb6598d/icons/128x128/io.github.peazip.PeaZip.png«Screenshots“Ùrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/peazip.PeaZip/a86f5e81d9fe5080b090d1f82fb6598d/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/peazip.PeaZip/a86f5e81d9fe5080b090d1f82fb6598d/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙrhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/peazip.PeaZip/a86f5e81d9fe5080b090d1f82fb6598d/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories½Utility,Archiving,Compression¯RichDescriptionÚÄPeaZip is a free, Open Source (LGPLv3) archive manager utility for BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

It is designed to be the go-to tool for encryption, with a focus on security, simplicity, and reliability. Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security, even from three-letter agencies like the NSA. Your privacy and security is under attack. Take it back with confidence by protecting your files with Picocrypt. For more info, please visit the project's GitHub repository. 

 A list of features:

 
Password generator: Picocrypt provides a secure password generator that you can use to create cryptographically secure passwords. You can customize the password length, as well as the types of characters to include. 
Comments: Use this to store notes, information, and text along with the file (it won't be encrypted). For example, you can put a description of the file you're encrypting before sending it to someone. When the person you sent it to drops the file into Picocrypt, your description will be shown to that person. Comments are not authenticated, meaning it can be freely modified by an attacker. Thus, it should only be used for informational purposes in trusted environments. 
Keyfiles: Picocrypt supports the use of keyfiles as an additional form of authentication (or the only form of authentication). It also provides a secure built-in keyfile generator. 
Paranoid mode: Using this mode will encrypt your data with both XChaCha20 and Serpent in a cascade fashion, and use HMAC-SHA3 to authenticate data instead of BLAKE2b. Argon2 parameters will be increased significantly as well. 
Reed-Solomon: This feature is very useful if you are planning to archive important data on a cloud provider or external medium for a long time. If checked, Picocrypt will use the Reed-Solomon error correction code to add 8 extra bytes for every 128 bytes of data to prevent file corruption. This means that up to ~3% of your file can corrupt and Picocrypt will still be able to correct the errors and decrypt your files with no corruption. 
Force decrypt: Picocrypt automatically checks for file integrity upon decryption. If the file has been modified or is corrupted, Picocrypt will automatically delete the output for the user's safety. If you would like to override these safeguards, check this option. Also, if this option is checked and the Reed-Solomon feature was used on the encrypted volume, Picocrypt will attempt to recover as much of the file as possible during decryption. 
Split into chunks: With Picocrypt, you can choose to split your output file into custom-sized chunks, so large files can become more manageable and easier to upload to cloud providers. Simply choose a unit (KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB) and enter your desired chunk size for that unit. To decrypt the chunks, simply drag one of them into Picocrypt and the chunks will be automatically recombined during decryption. 
Compress files: By default, Picocrypt uses a zip file with no compression to quickly merge files together when encrypting multiple files. If you would like to compress these files, however, simply check this box and the standard Deflate compression algorithm will be applied during encryption. 
Deniability: Picocrypt volumes typically follow an easily recognizable header format. However, if you want to hide the fact that you are encrypting your files, enabling this option will provide you with plausible deniability. The output volume will indistinguishable from a stream of random bytes, and no one can prove it is a volume without the correct password. 
Recursively: If you want to encrypt and/or decrypt a large set of files individually, this option will tell Picocrypt to go through every recursive file that you drop in and encrypt/decrypt it separately. This is useful, for example, if you are encrypting thousands of large documents and want to be able to decrypt any one of them in particular without having to download and decrypt the entire set of documents.

It also features some tweaks to enhance privacy, control, and transparency (almost all of which require manual activation or enabling).

 Ungoogled Chromium retains the default Chromium experience as closely as possible. Unlike other Chromium forks that have their own visions of a web browser, Ungoogled Chromium is essentially a drop-in replacement for Chromium.

 Without signing in to a Google Account, Chromium does pretty well in terms of security and privacy. However, Chromium still has some dependency on Google web services and binaries. In addition, Google designed Chromium to be easy and intuitive for users, which means they compromise on transparency and control of inner operations.

 Ungoogled Chromium addresses these issues in the following ways:

 
Remove all remaining background requests to any web services while building and running the browser 
Remove all code specific to Google web services 
Remove all uses of pre-made binaries from the source code, and replace them with user-provided alternatives when possible 
Disable features that inhibit control and transparency, and add or modify features that promote them (these changes will almost always require manual activation or enabling) 
 

These features are implemented as configuration flags, patches, and custom scripts.§Version±131.0.6778.85-1-1‰¥AppIdÙ!io.github.unicornyrainbow.secrets¤NameªKey Cutter§SummaryÙ-Easily generate passwords based on your needs­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ù“https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unicornyrainbow.secrets/cbd517e38d02ac5d0d5ae73ad21915c5/icons/128x128/io.github.unicornyrainbow.secrets.png«Screenshots’Ù|https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unicornyrainbow.secrets/cbd517e38d02ac5d0d5ae73ad21915c5/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙ|https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unicornyrainbow.secrets/cbd517e38d02ac5d0d5ae73ad21915c5/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngªCategories®Office,Utility¯RichDescriptionÙ^Easily generate passwords based on your needs, from a simple, Gtk 4 and Libadwaita based app. §Version¥1.3.0‰¥AppId¿io.github.unknownskl.greenlight¤NameªGreenlight§SummaryÙFGreenlight is an open-source client for xCloud and Xbox home streaming­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unknownskl.greenlight/412d50fbebae7ceb341e50f05f199e0a/icons/128x128/io.github.unknownskl.greenlight.png«Screenshots’Ùzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unknownskl.greenlight/412d50fbebae7ceb341e50f05f199e0a/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙzhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unknownskl.greenlight/412d50fbebae7ceb341e50f05f199e0a/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngªCategories¬Network,Game¯RichDescriptionÙGGreenlight is an open-source client for xCloud and Xbox home streaming.§Version¥2.3.1‰¥AppIdÙ$io.github.unrud.RecentFilter.desktop¤Name­Recent Filter§SummaryÙ2Exclude files and folders from recently used files­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù™https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unrud.RecentFilter.desktop/2edae4daa4a9b34163966a342abc06e5/icons/128x128/io.github.unrud.RecentFilter.desktop.pngÙ›https://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unrud.RecentFilter.desktop/2edae4daa4a9b34163966a342abc06e5/icons/128x128@2/io.github.unrud.RecentFilter.desktop.png«Screenshots‘Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/io/github/unrud.RecentFilter.desktop/2edae4daa4a9b34163966a342abc06e5/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories±Utility,FileTools¯RichDescriptionÙÖï»¿Exclude specific files and folders from appearing in the list of recently used files.

Well. You know what that is... Itâ€™s intended for casual gamers as the gameplay is simple... 

 It pictures a couple fighting each other at home. Thatâ€™s the reason why there is only 1 background and 2 playable characters. 

 This game is in French slang just because itâ€™s funny. No other reason. Besides, who really cares about, for instance, the story or even whatâ€™s told in such a game? 

 
 Use Alt-Enter to enter/exit full screen mode. 
 When playing with a keyboard, the LEFT player uses the E, S, R, D keys for buttons, and the F, C, V, B keys for moving; the RIGHT player uses the O, K, P, L keys for buttons, and the arrow keys for moving. 
 We strongly recommend you do not play on a keyboard as there are "ghosting" issues (some key combinations do not work).

After recruiting other bugs to help fight for them, they captured all of the Lady Bugs and are holding them prisoner. The leader of the Fire Ants, the new king of the Bugdom, is King Thorax. Once he is defeated, the Bugdom will return to the peaceful place it used to be.

While on his way to visit his family on the far side of the Bugdom, a Bully Bee swooped down and stole Skipâ€™s knapsack. Your job as Skip is to track down the Bully Bee and get your knapsack back.

You will make new friends in the Bugdom who will help you through each area. Keep an eye out for Sam the Snail and Sally the Chipmunk. Sam will usually make you prove your worthiness before he will help you, but Sally is just interested in gathering acorns, so be sure to brings lots of those to her. Additionally, the same Buddy Bugs that helped Rollie McFly defeat King Thorax will help you defeat most mean enemy bugs that you encounter.

In the Clown Department thousands of insane clowns initiate a massive pie fight. Throughout all of the departments, life arises...

Suddenly there is a commotion in the Doll Department! One of the cages in the Stuffed Animal Zoo has broken open â€“ hundreds of Fuzzy Bunnies hop out of the cage and scatter. The Fuzzy Bunnies, with their limited intellect, do not realize the danger they are in. The new metropolis of Toy Mart can be a very dangerous place for Fuzzy Bunnies to wander alone, and without help they stand little chance of surviving until morning.

The peaceful inhabitants of the Doll Department cry out for the Fuzzy Bunnies to return...but to no avail. What will they do? What will become of the Fuzzy Bunnies?

â€œI WILL HELP YOU!â€ storms a deep, resonant voice from one of the shelves. A hush crawls over the crowd of Fuzzy onlookers. A large package tumbles from the shelf onto the floor and bursts open...and a figure emerges. Yes, it's Mighty Mike â€“ the most powerful action figure money can buy!

The â€œprimitiveâ€ dinosaurs will attack you as you try to get their eggs, but just remember that itâ€™s for their own good that you blast them into oblivion!

Being a dinosaur from the future, you are equipped with several pieces of technology to help you in your mission:


Fusion Blaster: a multipurpose weapon for killing things.
Jet Pack: for flying over things that might kill you.
Temporal Compass: for finding time portals.
GPS Locator: for figuring out where you are and where you should go.


You can jump, swim, run around, jet around, shoot stuff, etc. The general rule to playing the game is â€œif it moves, kill it or itâ€™ll kill you.â€ You only have 20 minutes to collect all 5 egg species so being efficient about your actions is critical.

His mission was to find the unhatched eggs of ancient dinosaur species and return them to the future.

The rebels took the eggs to offworld bases where they planned on breeding the dinosaurs. Their goal was to create warriors for fighting their battle against Earth.

But the rebels left one egg behind. . . when it hatched, a new Nanosaur was born. This hatchling was sent on a mission to recover the stolen eggs and defeat the rebel forces.

This tool facilitates the storage of analysis data and automates the production of analysis documentation.

As systems increase in size and complexity, their analysis also increases in complexity. Quickly, the documentation can become a time consuming distraction from the analysis itself.

This tool allows the user to enter data in the standard format described in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 'STPA Handbook'. This includes Losses, Hazards, Unsafe Control Actions, and Scenarios including True Statements, and other information. The user can use these types to build their preferred analysis structure.

The tool automatically handles reference numbers for all items in the analysis, and data items can be linked and cross-referenced in the structure. This reduces effort, and automates all numbering. Items can be renumbered easily, and all links and cross-references are updated automatically.

Stpa Documentation Tool is 100% free and open source software based on open source licensing from Qt Company. Please refer to the Gitlab repository LICENSE.md at the project homepage.

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless, and with the connections in place, you can explore all of your knowledge in the interactive graph view. Obsidian supports CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), along with other useful notetaking features such as tags, LaTeX mathematical expressions, mermaid diagrams, footnotes, internal links and embedding Obsidian notes or external files. Obsidian also has a plugin system with 20+ supported plugins to expand its capabilities.

 The documentation can be accessed by opening the demo vault that is shipped in Obsidian.

 Obsidian will always remain free for personal use, no account or license is required for qualifying use cases described in the End User License Agreement. However, commercial users should purchase a license on Obsidian's website. Users also have the option to purchase a Catalyst license to get early access to insider builds and support the development. Additionally, Obsidian offers an optional paid hosting service for your notes. Details about this optional hosting service can be found on the Obsidian website.

 This distribution is verified by the Obsidian team but isn't supported

 Wayland support can enabled with --socket=wayland in Flatseal which can enable features like pinch zoom

 GPU acceleration can be disabled if necessary by setting OBSIDIAN_DISABLE_GPU=1 in Flatseal

 Pdflatex support in pandoc currently requires installing the org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive SDK

 Note: Regular users should disable "Automatic Updates" within Obsidian as public release updates are handled by Flatpak itself. Insiders should keep this enabled to receive insider builds, as those will not be made available on Flathub.

 This flatpak goes into great lengths to provide a nice experience for end users. In order for the Git plugin to work it requires permission to the ssh-auth socket (--socket=ssh-auth). It also exposes the home directory in the sandbox (required for Drag and Drop operations). If you don't use the Git plugin you can disable the ssh-auth socket permission, e.g. using Flatseal. You can also remove access to the home directory if you want and the flatpak will continue to work, albeit with reduced functionality. In case you do remove access to the homedir, note that in order for things to not break for the Git plugin, --persist=.ssh flag has been passed and a bind mount to ~/.var/app/md.obsidian.Obsidian/ is created by flatpak, allowing that location to be used for persistent data (but your home directory's .ssh remains unaccessible)§Version¥1.7.7‰¥AppId¸me.acristoffers.Lachesis¤Name¨Lachesis§Summary±Moirai supervisor­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/icons/128x128/me.acristoffers.Lachesis.png«Screenshots”Ùshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/me/acristoffers/Lachesis/061d00d3ecb3561a8551cb3578415d19/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngªCategories³Science,Development¯RichDescriptionÚ©Lachesis is the frontend of the control platform. This application allows you to configure the hardware, execute system response tests and run controllers with an easy to use interface. The used input and output signals, as well as variables, can be seen graphically, updating in real time. It works only as a frontend, meaning that all data is stored and managed in/by the moirai server. The server is also responsible for executing the controller. That means that you can install moirai in a dedicated computer, like a Raspberry Pi, and Lachesis in another one, using Lachesis like a remote control for your control system. This allows various user to share plant configuration. §Version¦1.3.12‰¥AppId¸me.ahola.aphototoollibre¤Name´A Photo Tool (Libre)§Summary¶Photo editor for Linux­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots“Ùehttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/aphototool/A-Photo-Tool-Libre/main/pics/APhotoTool(Libre)Debian.pngÙnhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/aphototool/A-Photo-Tool-Libre/main/pics/APhotoTool(Libre)ToolsScreenShot.pngÙrhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/aphototool/A-Photo-Tool-Libre/main/pics/APhotoTool(Libre)LightModeScreenShot.pngªCategories¨Graphics¯RichDescriptionÚ¾Easy to use photo editing software.

 Keep your conversations private. Proton Mail is encrypted email from Switzerland. Used by millions worldwide, our all-new email app protects your communications and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox. 

 The Wall Street Journal says:

 â€œProton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually impossible for anyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.â€ 

 With the all-new Proton Mail app, you can:

 
Create a @proton.me or @protonmail.com email address 
Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease 
Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts 
Easily manage your email with conversations 
 Keep your inbox tidy and clean with folders, labels and simple swipe-gestures 
Receive new email notifications 
Send Password-protected Emails to anyone 
Enjoy your inbox in dark mode 
 

Why use Proton Mail?

 
 Proton Mail is free â€” We believe everyone deserves privacy. Upgrade to a paid plan to get more done and support our mission. 
 Easy to use â€” Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to read, organize, and write your emails. 
 Your inbox is yours â€” We donâ€™t spy on your communications to show you targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules. 
 Rigorous encryption â€” Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No one can read your emails but you. Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access encryption. 
 Unmatched protection â€” We offer strong phishing, spam, and spying/tracking protection for all your communications. 
 

Industry Leading Security Features

 Messages are stored on Proton Mail servers using end-to-end encryption at all times and are transmitted securely between Proton servers and user devices. This largely eliminates the risk of message interception. 

 Zero Access to Your Email Content

 Proton Mail's zero access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a way that makes it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to. This means we don't have the technical ability to decrypt your messages. 

 Open-Source Cryptography

 Proton Mail's open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security experts from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection. Proton Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP, while all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using open-source libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption algorithms used do not have clandestinely built-in back doors. 

 Proton Mail in the press:

 â€œProton Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption, making it impossible for outside parties to monitor.â€ Forbes

 Get the password manager created by the scientists who met at CERN behind Proton Mail, the worldâ€™s largest encrypted email provider. Proton Pass is open source, end-to-end encrypted, and protected by Swiss privacy laws.

 Pass offers more than other free password managers and has no ads or data collection. You can use it for free forever on all your devices to create and store unlimited passwords, autofill logins, generate 2FA codes, create email aliases, secure your notes, and more.

 How can Proton Pass be free forever?

 We offer Pass for free because everyone deserves online privacy and security. This is possible thanks to our supportive community on paid plans. If you would like to support our work and get access to premium features, consider upgrading your plan.

 Protect more than just your passwords.

 Join over 100 million people who have signed up for Protonâ€™s privacy ecosystem, which includes Proton Mail, Proton Drive, Proton Calendar, Proton VPN, and more. Take back control of your privacy online with our encrypted email, calendar, file storage, and VPN. 

 Protect your logins and their metadata with battle-tested end-to-end encryption

 While many other password managers only encrypt your password, Proton Pass uses end-to-end encryption on all your stored login details (including your username, the website address, and more). Pass protects your information with the same battle-tested encryption libraries all Proton services use.

 Audit Passâ€™s open-source code

 Like all other Proton services, Pass is open source and built on the principle of trust through transparency. As scientists, we know that transparency and peer review lead to better security. All Proton Pass apps are open source, meaning anyone can verify our security claims for themselves.

 With Proton Pass, you can:

 
Store and auto-sync unlimited logins on unlimited devices: You can create, store, and manage your credentials from anywhere with our browser extensions and apps for Android and iPhone/iPad. 
Sign in faster with Proton Pass autofill: You no longer need to copy and paste your username and password. Easily and securely log in with Proton Pass autofill technology. 
Avoid weak passwords: With our built-in secure password generator, you can easily generate strong, unique, and random passwords based on the security requirements for every website you sign up to. 
Safely store encrypted notes: You can save private notes in Pass and access them on all your devices. 
Protect Proton Pass with biometric login access: You can add an extra layer of protection to Proton Pass by using your fingerprint or face to unlock the app. 
Create unique email addresses with hide-my-email aliases: Proton Pass helps you hide your personal email address with email aliases. Keep spam out of your inbox, avoid being tracked everywhere, and protect yourself from data breaches. 
Make 2FA easy with our built-in authenticator: With Passâ€™s integrated 2FA authenticator, using 2FA is finally fast and convenient. Easily add a 2FA code for any website and autofill it when you log in. 
Easily organize and share your sensitive data with vaults: Manage your logins, secure notes, and email aliases with vaults. In the next version of Pass, youâ€™ll be able to share individual items or an entire vault with your family, friends, or colleagues. 
Quick offline access to your login data: Access your stored passwords and notes in Pass from wherever you are, even when your phone has no internet connection.

 The snowball turns green when the next level portals have opened, the portals are located at the north and south poles of the sphere.

 The larger the snowballs you collect higher the score. Gold snow is double the reward of white.

 Picking up snow increases your speed temporarily; the idea is to enter a flow of collecting snow so that your speed stays up.

 Try not to hit the trees as they will slow you down and reduce the mass of your snowball unless your snowball is large enough to consume them. Trees will shrink slightly as you approach them to show that they can be "consumed" aka rolled over without a penalty to snowball size, only speed.

 The goal? If you need one: complete each level or a sequence of levels with the highest score in the shortest time. I just play it to get lost in a trance and typically play 10 minute long games.

 The "any key" on your keyboard will open the menu, and all the other controls are bound to the mouse:

 Left click to toggle mouse focus, scroll and right click for zoom, X1 and X2 or Mouse 4 and 5 will increment or decrement the mouse sensitivity.

Primarily it is intended for the analysis of height fields obtained by scanning probe microscopy techniques (AFM, MFM, STM, SNOM/NSOM) and it supports a lot of SPM data formats. However, it can be used for general height field and (greyscale) image processing, for instance for the analysis of profilometry data or thickness maps from imaging spectrophotometry. 

 Gwyddion provides a large number of data processing functions, including all the standard statistical characterization, levelling and data correction, filtering or grain marking functions. And since the developers are active SPM users, the program also contains a number of specific, uncommon, odd and experimental data processing methods they found useful â€“ and you may find them useful too. §Version¤2.67‰¥AppId¶net.hovancik.Stretchly¤Name©Stretchly§Summary»The break time reminder app­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù}https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/hovancik/Stretchly/b239d7ac0115607177a48a87cab2faee/icons/128x128/net.hovancik.Stretchly.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/hovancik/Stretchly/b239d7ac0115607177a48a87cab2faee/icons/128x128@2/net.hovancik.Stretchly.png«Screenshots“Ùqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/hovancik/Stretchly/b239d7ac0115607177a48a87cab2faee/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/hovancik/Stretchly/b239d7ac0115607177a48a87cab2faee/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/hovancik/Stretchly/b239d7ac0115607177a48a87cab2faee/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÙjStretchly is a cross-platform Electron app that reminds you to take breaks when working on your computer. §Version¦1.16.0‰¥AppId»net.huitsi.ParallelOverhead¤Name±Parallel Overhead§Summary³Endless runner game­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù‡https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/huitsi/ParallelOverhead/929ba74f548444cb4a6aacf5f8ce680c/icons/128x128/net.huitsi.ParallelOverhead.pngÙ‰https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/huitsi/ParallelOverhead/929ba74f548444cb4a6aacf5f8ce680c/icons/128x128@2/net.huitsi.ParallelOverhead.png«Screenshots“Ùvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/huitsi/ParallelOverhead/929ba74f548444cb4a6aacf5f8ce680c/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/huitsi/ParallelOverhead/929ba74f548444cb4a6aacf5f8ce680c/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/huitsi/ParallelOverhead/929ba74f548444cb4a6aacf5f8ce680c/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories¯Game,ArcadeGame¯RichDescriptionÚfParallel Overhead is a colorful endless runner game where you take control of the ships Truth and Beauty on a groundbreaking trip through hyperspace.

It does not have any cool features: no play against other humans (neither locally nor via the network), no play computer vs computer, no stats, no time control, no learning from play, no analysis mode, no variants for the rules of play. It's just to have some fun playing against the AI. The only additions: you can undo moves; and the AI will indicate when it thinks the position is dead even (you may take that as the AI offering a draw). You, on the other hand, cannot offer a draw: that would be pointless, as the AI is not designed to handle it anyway. Just quit or start a new game if you feel the current game is going nowhere.

The AI uses a Monte Carlo tree search variation with a hand crafted evaluation function that is based on pattern counts (e.g., the number of open mills) and also has perfect knowledge of the game theoretic values of all 3 on 3 positions.

Muehle is distributed free of charge and comes without any (not even implied) waranties. So don't use it.

We have developed a flexible open source game engine (the OpenRA engine) that provides a common platform for rebuilding and reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games (the OpenRA mods). 

 The OpenRA mods include new features and gameplay improvements that bring them into the modern era: 

 
A choice between â€œright clickâ€ and classic â€œleft clickâ€ control schemes 
Overhauled sidebar interfaces for managing production 
Support for game replays and an observer interface designed for streaming games online 
The â€œfog of warâ€ that obscures the battlefield outside your units' line of sight 
Civilian structures that can be captured to provide benefits 
Units gain experience as they fight and improve when they earn new ranks 
 

 OpenRA is 100% free, and comes bundled with three distinct mods. When you run a mod for the first time the game can automatically download the original game assets, or you can use the original game disks. §Version°release-20231010‰¥AppIdÙ%net.opentabletdriver.OpenTabletDriver¤Name°OpenTabletDriver§SummaryÙ!Cross-platform tablet driver tool­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ù›https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/opentabletdriver/OpenTabletDriver/5dc27035788d5268f6299c930bf62def/icons/128x128/net.opentabletdriver.OpenTabletDriver.png«Screenshots“Ù€https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/opentabletdriver/OpenTabletDriver/5dc27035788d5268f6299c930bf62def/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙ€https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/opentabletdriver/OpenTabletDriver/5dc27035788d5268f6299c930bf62def/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙ€https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/opentabletdriver/OpenTabletDriver/5dc27035788d5268f6299c930bf62def/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories¨Settings¯RichDescriptionÙàOpenTabletDriver is an open source, cross platform, user mode tablet driver.

It combines a shallow learning curve and an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interface with powerful features such as scriptability and extensibility. SciDAVis runs on GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS X; possibly also on other platforms like *BSD, although this is untested.

SciDAVis is similar in its field of application to proprietary Windows applications like Origin and SigmaPlot as well as free applications like QtiPlot, Labplot and Gnuplot.

What sets SciDAVis apart from the above is its emphasis on providing a friendly and open environment (in the software as well as the project) for new and experienced users alike. Particularly, this means that we will try to provide good documentation on all levels, ranging from userâ€™s manual over tutorials down to and including documentation of the internal APIs We encourage users to share their experiences on our forums and on our mailing lists.

It makes a clean break at the correct position to burn the files to an Audio CD without any dead air between the tracks.

wavbreaker also supports breaking up MP2 and MP3 files without re-encoding meaning it's fast and there is no generational loss. Decoding (using mpg123) is only done for playback and waveform display.

The GUI displays a waveform summary of the entire file at the top. The middle portion displays a zoomed-in view that allows you to select where to start playing and where it will make the break. The bottom portion contains a list of track breaks. You may change file names and uncheck parts that you do not want to have written out to disk when saving.

There is also a command line tool wavmerge to merge WAV files together. If you download a show and don't like how it was tracked, you can merge them together with wavmerge and then break them back up with wavbreaker. The wavmerge tool will only work on files that have the same format (for example, 44.100 Hz sample rate, 16-bit sample size, etc.).§Version¤0.16‰¥AppId¶net.sourceforge.wxEDID¤Name¦wxEDID§Summary¸Read and edit EDID files­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù}https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/sourceforge/wxEDID/b675dd84f8e7554515c3b4f7a18c4a74/icons/128x128/net.sourceforge.wxEDID.pngÙhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/sourceforge/wxEDID/b675dd84f8e7554515c3b4f7a18c4a74/icons/128x128@2/net.sourceforge.wxEDID.png«Screenshots‘Ùqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/sourceforge/wxEDID/b675dd84f8e7554515c3b4f7a18c4a74/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÚ×wxEDID is a wxWidgets - based EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) editor.

It is a completely free, fast-paced first-person shooter for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

 Speed and movement is what Warsow is all about. Like a true cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge, and walljump your way through the game. Grab power-ups before your enemy does, plant a bomb before anyone sees you, and steal the enemyâ€™s flag before they know what is going on!

 Our goal is to offer a fast and fun competitive first-person shooter without hard graphical violence - Warsow has no blood or guts flying around. Red stars instead of blood indicate hits and colored cubes replace guts as gib effects.§Version¥2.1.2‰¥AppIdµnet.waterfox.waterfox¤Name¨Waterfox§SummaryÙHA lightweight, free and open source web browser built for the modern web­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ù{https://dl.flathub.org/media/net/waterfox/waterfox/a3eb059438f1e389a3c00a8cf5bf8f9a/icons/128x128/net.waterfox.waterfox.png«Screenshots“Ùphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/waterfox/waterfox/a3eb059438f1e389a3c00a8cf5bf8f9a/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/waterfox/waterfox/a3eb059438f1e389a3c00a8cf5bf8f9a/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/net/waterfox/waterfox/a3eb059438f1e389a3c00a8cf5bf8f9a/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories²Network,WebBrowser¯RichDescriptionÚImportant: This flatpak is not affiliated with, in any way, BrowserWorks Ltd. or the Mozilla Foundation

Aegisub makes it quick and easy to time subtitles to audio, and features many powerful tools for styling them, including a built-in real-time video preview.

 Aegisub was originally created as a tool to make typesetting, particularly in anime fansubs, a less painful experience. At the time of the start of the project, many other programs that supported the Advanced Substation Alpha format lacked (and in many cases, still lack; development on several competing programs have since been dropped for various reasons completely unrelated to Aegisub) many vital functions, or were too buggy and/or unreliable to be really useful.

 Since then, Aegisub has grown into a fully fledged, highly customizable subtitle editor. It features a lot of convenient tools to help you with timing, typesetting, editing and translating subtitles, as well as a powerful scripting environment called Automation (originally mostly intended for creating karaoke effects, Automation can now be used much else, including creating macros and various other convenient tools).

 Some highlights of Aegisub:

 
Simple and intuitive yet powerful interface for editing subtitles 
Support for many formats and character sets 
Powerful video mode 
Visual typesetting tools 
Intuitive and customizable audio timing mode 
Fully scriptable through the Automation module

In the most basic game mode, you can only make sudden right angle turns and are trapped with others in an inescapable arena. The last survivor wins. 

 Focus is firmly on online play. Pick a server that sounds fun from the server browser, hop in, stay and play there for as long as you like with the same people. Online, you will find many variations of the core gameplay principle. There are other objectives than mere survival. In Fortress Mode, two teams face each other. Each team owns a Fortress Zone and needs to defend it while trying to conquer the enemy teams' Fortress. In Sumo Mode, everyone needs to stay inside a shrinking circle to stay alive. 

 The game supports custom maps (sadly without an editor) and just about every gameplay variable can be tweaked to your, or more likely, the server owner's heart content. Speed, map size, trail length and timeouts are just the start. Even the rigid right angle turn rule can be bent! §Version©0.2.9.2.3‰¥AppId³org.arrl.trustedqsl¤NameªTrustedQSL§Summary¸Radio Contact validation­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ùwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/arrl/trustedqsl/92ab4b7b150444b05a33dcc0194c928a/icons/128x128/org.arrl.trustedqsl.png«Screenshots’Ùnhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/arrl/trustedqsl/92ab4b7b150444b05a33dcc0194c928a/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙnhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/arrl/trustedqsl/92ab4b7b150444b05a33dcc0194c928a/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngªCategories±Utility,FileTools¯RichDescriptionÚEThis is the TrustedQSL project, which provides tools for digitally signing Amateur Radio QSO records.

The solution of continuum mechanical boundary value problems requires a constitutive response that connects deformation and stress at each material point. This problem is solved in DAMASK on the basis of crystal plasticity using a variety of constitutive models and homogenization approaches. However, treating mechanics in isolation is no longer sufficient to study emergent advanced high-strength materials. In these materials, deformation happens interrelated with displacive phase transformation, significant heating, and potential damage evolution. Therefore, DAMASK is capable of handling multi-physics problems. Following a modular approach, additional field equations are solved in a fully coupled way using a staggered approach.

Music can be typed in at the PC-Keyboard, or played in via MIDI controller. The typesetting is done in the background by LilyPond while you work, and is generally flawless publication quality. Any final tweaks to can be done on the final typeset score with the mouse if needed. This represents an enormous practical improvement over the most programs which require you to re-position colliding notation constantly as you enter the music.

Unique to Denemo are methods to enter music in a musical, rather than mechanical, manner. You play in a phrase or two of the music using the number keys to indicate the note durations. Audible feedback lets you hear what you have entered; playing the phrase a second time on a real instrument adds the pitches to the rhythm. Again, Denemo gives you audible feedback so that you donâ€™t enter E-flat when you meant D-sharp etc.

Another great feature is the ability to put links in the score to the original source document that you transcribed from. Clicking on such a link opens the document for you and highlights the bar you are looking at. You can use this to continue work from where you left off, or for looking back at the source to check a doubtful bar.§Version¦2.6.34‰¥AppIdµorg.deskflow.deskflow¤Name¨Deskflow§SummaryÙ#Software Keyboard and mouse sharing­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ù{https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/deskflow/deskflow/8cd8ba9e0d65348687725e765083bbe1/icons/128x128/org.deskflow.deskflow.png«Screenshots‘Ùphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/deskflow/deskflow/8cd8ba9e0d65348687725e765083bbe1/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÙTUse your keyboard and mouse to control other machines on the network or be controle §Version¦1.17.2‰¥AppId³org.desmume.DeSmuME¤Name§DeSmuME§Summary´Nintendo DS emulator­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/desmume/DeSmuME/3781ed643f83f52580c716f3879e5e26/icons/128x128/org.desmume.DeSmuME.pngÙyhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/desmume/DeSmuME/3781ed643f83f52580c716f3879e5e26/icons/128x128@2/org.desmume.DeSmuME.png«Screenshots‘Ùnhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/desmume/DeSmuME/3781ed643f83f52580c716f3879e5e26/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories­Game,Emulator¯RichDescriptionÙ#DeSmuME is a Nintendo DS emulator. §Version¦0.9.11‰¥AppId¸org.develz.Crawl.desktop¤Name¸Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup§SummaryÙ"Roguelike dungeon exploration game­ContentRatingÚœviolence-cartoon:mild,violence-fantasy:none,violence-realistic:none,violence-bloodshed:mild,violence-sexual:none,drugs-alcohol:none,drugs-narcotics:none,drugs-tobacco:none,sex-nudity:none,sex-themes:none,language-profanity:none,language-humor:none,language-discrimination:none,social-chat:none,social-info:none,social-audio:none,social-location:none,social-contacts:none,money-purchasing:none,money-gambling:none¥Icons’Ùhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/develz/Crawl.desktop/c900c60ff0a3bd2da04e0b4c6c0fdfc8/icons/128x128/org.develz.Crawl.desktop.pngÙƒhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/develz/Crawl.desktop/c900c60ff0a3bd2da04e0b4c6c0fdfc8/icons/128x128@2/org.develz.Crawl.desktop.png«Screenshots’Ùshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/develz/Crawl.desktop/c900c60ff0a3bd2da04e0b4c6c0fdfc8/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/develz/Crawl.desktop/c900c60ff0a3bd2da04e0b4c6c0fdfc8/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngªCategories¤Game¯RichDescriptionÚCrawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of similar games like Rogue, Hack and Moria.

Firo believes in the importance of financial privacy in cryptocurrency as an essential element in maintaining the original goal of cryptocurrency: to be a public utility for money. We have seen how freedom of commerce or even access to our savings are things that are no longer things that can be taken for granted and authoritarian governments have increasingly used money as a tool of control.

 As fiat currencies go increasingly digital with some going as far as totally replacing physical cash, we lose control over our own money instead relying on intermediaries. Bitcoin was originally created as an answer to this by ensuring you can be self sovereign over your money and to serve as uncensorable and unseizable money that isn't controlled by any one entity.

 Bitcoin's lack of privacy however has now made it much easier to seize or blacklist funds and due to ossification of the protocol, is unlikely to take serious steps to address this. Firo has dedicated itself to being a privacy preserving cryptocurrency and have designed and built trustless privacy protocols such as Lelantus and Lelantus Spark that have inspired and shaped the designs of other privacy protocols (for e.g. Triptych, Seraphis, Lelantus-MW).§Version©0.14.14.0‰¥AppIdµorg.fkoehler.KTailctl¤Name¨KTailctl§Summary¼Manage and monitor Tailscale­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù{https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/fkoehler/KTailctl/ce656a43624b5389e5f033da00741cb6/icons/128x128/org.fkoehler.KTailctl.pngÙ}https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/fkoehler/KTailctl/ce656a43624b5389e5f033da00741cb6/icons/128x128@2/org.fkoehler.KTailctl.png«Screenshots”Ùphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/fkoehler/KTailctl/ce656a43624b5389e5f033da00741cb6/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/fkoehler/KTailctl/ce656a43624b5389e5f033da00741cb6/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/fkoehler/KTailctl/ce656a43624b5389e5f033da00741cb6/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/fkoehler/KTailctl/ce656a43624b5389e5f033da00741cb6/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngªCategories¦System¯RichDescriptionÚHKTailctl provides a graphical interface for the Tailscale mesh network with easy access to settings, host information as well as the ability to send/receive files.

Its gameplay can be likened to the games in the Diablo series.

The Empyrean Campaign is a game made by the Flare team. The story begins with the player being exiled from their homeland of Empyrean, resulting in them embarking on a quest to regain entry. This journey takes the player through many regions, with plenty of side quests along the way.

The player can choose between three different character classes with distinct strengths and skills. Each character class has unique powers to unlock and improve as they level up.


Brute - A close-quarters fighter who utilizes swords, throwing-knives and other bladed weapons.
Scout - A ranged weapon and trap specialist who primarily uses bows to defeat its foes.
Adept - A spell caster who challenges enemies with fire, ice and lightning-based attacks.


Players may find or buy different items to protect themselves from attacks or boost their stats. These include potions, scrolls, weapons, armor, and magical artifacts. Along with the normal equipment, there are enchanted, rare, and unique pieces of gear that provide extra bonuses.

The Flare engine is licensed under GPL 3, whereas the Empyrean Campaign is licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.

It is an example of how to use Flatpak to build and distribute an application, and can be used as a reference implementation.

 While the demo application uses Qt and the KDE runtime, the basic principles that it demonstrates are applicable to applications that use other runtimes and toolkits.

 With YOGA, you will be able to save about 30Â % of space on JPEGs and 20Â % on PNGs. On WebP images, you will only save few percents... but converting a JPEG to a lossy WebP can reduce image size to a half and converting a PNG to a lossy WebP can save you 35Â % on average. 

 Please note that image optimization can be slow and may require a lot of RAM, especially for JPEGs.

With parametric modeling, you can easily modify your designs by adjusting parameters in the model history. FreeCAD is suitable for a wide range of uses, from product design and mechanical engineering to architecture and 3D printing. 

 The software allows you to create constrained 2D sketches, which can be used as the basis for more complex 3D models. It includes tools to adjust dimensions, extract design details, and produce production-ready technical drawings. FreeCAD is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and supports various file formats like STEP, IGES, STL, SVG, DXF, OBJ, IFC, and more, making it easy to fit into existing workflows. It also supports customization through Python scripting for those who want to automate tasks or develop custom features. 

 FreeCAD offers several specialized workbenches, including tools for Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Building Information Modeling (BIM), CAM / CNC and robot movement simulation. You can expand its capabilities with add-ons, plugins, and macros created by the FreeCAD community, which can be installed directly from the application. This flexibility makes it a practical choice for both professionals and hobbyists. §Version¥1.0.0‰¥AppId²org.freeciv.gtk322¤Name¸Freeciv gtk+-3.22 client§SummaryÙ+Gtk+-3.22 based client for the Freeciv game­ContentRating³social-chat:intense¥Icons‘Ùuhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/freeciv/gtk322/84b2e553cb36e93ada2a81435e74fa08/icons/128x128/org.freeciv.gtk322.png«Screenshots’Ùmhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/freeciv/gtk322/84b2e553cb36e93ada2a81435e74fa08/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙmhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/freeciv/gtk322/84b2e553cb36e93ada2a81435e74fa08/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngªCategories±Game,StrategyGame¯RichDescriptionÚUFreeciv is a Free and Open Source empire-building strategy game inspired by the history of human civilization.

This allows us to have a running program at all times and also to release an unfinished but working game once in a while.

You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers unless you allow them to do so.

 Privacy: Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default.

 Security: Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have a 25 word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

It is useful both as a simple calculator and as a research or educational tool. The syntax is very intuitive and is designed to mimic how mathematics is usually written. GEL is the name of its extension language, it stands for Genius Extension Language, clever isn't it? In fact, many of the standard genius functions are written in GEL itself.

What can it do?


Arbitrary precision integers, multiple precision floats.
Complex numbers, stored in Cartesian coordinates as usual.
Math-like-looking expressions, tries to be as much a what-you-mean-is-what-Genius-understands, up to a limit of course.
Matrix calculations / Linear Algebra, with many related functions.
Number theory.
Calculus, numerical and even very limited symbolic calculations.
Statistics, all the basic statistical functions.
Numerical equation solving, polynomial roots, etc...
Combinatorics.
Most common elementary / trigonometric functions.
Modular arithmetic, including inversions and modular arithmetic on matrices.
A complete programming language, with automatic typing. In fact large part of Genius standard library is written in GEL.
2D Function line plots, standard 2D graphs of up to 10 functions at once, with possibility to export to EPS or PNG.
Parametric plots, with possibility to export to EPS or PNG.
3D Function surface plots, with possibility to export to EPS or PNG
Slopefield/Vectorfield plotting.
GUI IDE where you can edit and run/test your programs.
Can output matrices in LaTeX, Troff (eqn) or MathML, this is I think a very cool feature that allows you to copy stuff directly from Genius to a document in LaTeX, troff or MathML.

It is a Free replacement for the proprietary program SPSS, and appears very similar to it with a few exceptions. The most important of these exceptions are, that there are no â€œtime bombsâ€; your copy of PSPP will not â€œexpireâ€ or deliberately stop working in the future. Neither are there any artificial limits on the number of cases or variables which you can use. There are no additional packages to purchase in order to get â€œadvancedâ€ functions; all functionality that PSPP currently supports is in the core package.

 PSPP is a stable and reliable application. It can perform descriptive statistics, T-tests, anova, linear and logistic regression, measures of association, cluster analysis, reliability and factor analysis, non-parametric tests and more. Its backend is designed to perform its analyses as fast as possible, regardless of the size of the input data. You can use PSPP with its graphical interface or the more traditional syntax commands.

 A brief list of some of PSPP's features.

 
Support for over 1 billion cases 
Support for over 1 billion variables 
Syntax and data files which are compatible with those of SPSS

Limitations of the Flatpak version:

 
Although built with Mono 6, this Flatpak uses .NET 8 for building C# solutions in Godot projects. To (re)build a C# solution in the Godot editor, make sure that "Editor -> Editor Settings --> Mono --> Builds --> Build Tool" is set to "dotnet CLI", and not "MSBuild (Mono)", before (re)building the C# solution, otherwise Godot won't be able to find MSBuild. It should be set to "dotnet CLI" by default, but if it isn't, reset it by going to the editor settings as previously described. 
C#/.NET/Mono external editor support does not work out-of-the-box, though this is currently being discussed and worked on. See: https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.GodotSharp/issues/2 and https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot3Sharp/issues/2 
External script editors are still supported (for use outside of Mono), but you need to follow the steps described here: https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot3Sharp#using-an-external-script-editor 
After the first C# script is created, it is necessary to click build within Godot. Alternatively, running dotnet restore in the IDE's terminal would work as well.

Peruse was created as a way to make exactly that as easy and pleasant as possible, and to simply get out of the way and let you read your comic books. One could say that it allows you to peruse your comic books at your leisure, but that would be a silly way of putting it - so, peruse your comic books at your leisure! 

 One of the ways in which Peruse ensures your reading experience is as pleasant and effortless as possible is to allow you to simply pick up where you last left off. The welcome page in the application (first screenshot below) shows you your most recently read comics, and shows your progress through them. To pick up where you left off, simply tap the top left item and you will be taken right to the page you were reading before you had to stop.

The fact that the software is usable serves primarily to validate the accuracy of the documentation (how else can you prove that you have recreated the hardware faithfully?). Over time, MAME (originally stood for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) absorbed the sister-project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System), so MAME now documents a wide variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game consoles and calculators, in addition to the arcade video games that were its initial focus. §Version¥0.271‰¥AppIdµorg.manaplus.ManaPlus¤Name´The Mana Plus Client§SummaryÙ6Extended client for The Mana World and similar servers­ContentRatingÙ?violence-cartoon:mild,violence-fantasy:mild,social-chat:intense¥Icons’Ù{https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/manaplus/ManaPlus/df2ae10a465ba5455464fd50c2d361c0/icons/128x128/org.manaplus.ManaPlus.pngÙ}https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/manaplus/ManaPlus/df2ae10a465ba5455464fd50c2d361c0/icons/128x128@2/org.manaplus.ManaPlus.png«Screenshots“Ùphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/manaplus/ManaPlus/df2ae10a465ba5455464fd50c2d361c0/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/manaplus/ManaPlus/df2ae10a465ba5455464fd50c2d361c0/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/manaplus/ManaPlus/df2ae10a465ba5455464fd50c2d361c0/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories²Game,AdventureGame¯RichDescriptionÚĞManaPlus is extended client for Evol Online, The Mana World and similar servers based on eAthena fork.

It aims to support the typical interactive uses of SSH, plus:


Mosh keeps the session alive if the client goes to sleep and wakes up later, or temporarily loses its Internet connection.
Mosh allows the client and server to "roam" and change IP addresses, while keeping the connection alive. Unlike SSH, Mosh can be used while switching between Wi-Fi networks or from Wi-Fi to cellular data to wired Ethernet.
The Mosh client runs a predictive model of the server's behavior in the background and tries to guess intelligently how each keystroke will affect the screen state. When it is confident in its predictions, it will show them to the user while waiting for confirmation from the server. Most typing and uses of the left- and right-arrow keys can be echoed immediately.


As a result, Mosh is usable on high-latency links, e.g. on a cellular data connection or spotty Wi-Fi. In distinction from previous attempts at local echo modes in other protocols, Mosh works properly with full-screen applications such as emacs, vi, alpine, and irssi, and automatically recovers from occasional prediction errors within an RTT. On high-latency links, Mosh underlines its predictions while they are outstanding and removes the underline when they are confirmed by the server.

Mosh does not support X forwarding or the non-interactive uses of SSH, including port forwarding.§Version¥1.4.0‰¥AppId·org.mozilla.Thunderbird¤Name«Thunderbird§SummaryÙSThunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring client­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots’ÙRhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/thunderbird/flatpak-screenshots/main/image_1.pngÙRhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/thunderbird/flatpak-screenshots/main/image_2.pngªCategoriesÙYCalendar,Chat,ContactManagement,Email,Feed,IRCClient,InstantMessaging,Network,News,Office¯RichDescriptionÚThunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring client, thatâ€™s easy to set up and customize.

It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable. 

 Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in C++, C, Fortran, or other languages. §Version¥9.2.0‰¥AppId±org.okstar.ok-msg¤Name­OkMSG Desktop§SummaryÙoOkMSG æ˜¯ç”±OkStar(okstar.org)ç¤¾åŒºå¼€å‘å’Œç»´æŠ¤çš„æ³¨é‡æ•°æ®å®‰å…¨ä¸ä¿æŠ¤çš„ä¼ä¸šé€šè®¯ååŒå·¥å…·ã€‚­ContentRatingÙTsocial-chat:intense,social-info:intense,social-audio:intense,social-location:intense¥Icons‘Ùshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/okstar/ok-msg/cd0d0fb648e68d9f3086595ab8bb9243/icons/128x128/org.okstar.ok-msg.png«Screenshots‘Ùlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/okstar/ok-msg/cd0d0fb648e68d9f3086595ab8bb9243/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories®Network,Office¯RichDescriptionÚOkMSG æ”¯æŒç‹¬ç«‹ç§æœ‰åŒ–éƒ¨ç½²çš„é›†å³æ—¶æ¶ˆæ¯ã€è¯­éŸ³ã€è§†é¢‘é€šè¯ã€å‘é€æ–‡ä»¶ã€ä¼šè®®ç­‰ å¤šç§åŠŸèƒ½äºä¸€èº«çš„å¼€æºé¡¹ç›®ï¼ŒåŒæ—¶è®©æ‚¨çš„ä¼ä¸šæ›´åŠ æœ‰æ•ˆå¼€å¯åä½œã€æœ‰æ•ˆæ²Ÿé€šï¼Œ æ§åˆ¶æˆæœ¬ï¼Œå¼€æ‹“æ–°ä¸šåŠ¡ï¼Œå¹¶å¸®åŠ©æ‚¨åŠ é€Ÿå‘å±•ä¸šåŠ¡ã€‚§Version§24.03.0‰¥AppIdºorg.olivevideoeditor.Olive¤Name¥Olive§Summary·Non-linear video editor­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ù…https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/olivevideoeditor/Olive/e36315cc56ee40a8d7cbad08b87cdb6b/icons/128x128/org.olivevideoeditor.Olive.png«Screenshots‘Ùuhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/olivevideoeditor/Olive/e36315cc56ee40a8d7cbad08b87cdb6b/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories³AudioVideo,Recorder¯RichDescriptionÙ‡Olive is a free non-linear video editor aiming to provide a fully-featured alternative to high-end professional video editing software.§Version¥0.1.2‰¥AppId±org.omegat.OmegaT¤Name¦OmegaT§SummaryÙ=A simple, open-source translation memory manager and CAT tool­ContentRating°social-info:mild¥Icons’Ùshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/omegat/OmegaT/b7233c4eb33f2bbf5f520dc46aba8a3c/icons/128x128/org.omegat.OmegaT.pngÙuhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/omegat/OmegaT/b7233c4eb33f2bbf5f520dc46aba8a3c/icons/128x128@2/org.omegat.OmegaT.png«Screenshots‘Ùlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/omegat/OmegaT/b7233c4eb33f2bbf5f520dc46aba8a3c/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories¦Office¯RichDescriptionÚOmegaT is a free translation memory application that works on Windows, macOS, Linux...

MSX was a standard for Z80-based home computers, and was a (largely) Japanese attempt to establish a single standard in home computing similar to VHS in video. 

 The MSX standard was designed by ASCII Corporation in Japan, in cooperation with Microsoft Japan. The later of which provided the extended BASIC for the machine. 

 In addition to emulating MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, MSX Turbo R and many of it's peripherals, openMSX also supports emulating the ColecoVision and Sega SG-1000 game consoles and the SpectraVideo SVI-318 and SVI-328 home computer systems. 

 Note: by default the openMSX emulator only ships with the C-BIOS open-source BIOS implementation. This BIOS is restricted to cartridge based MSX games. For a full MSX or SVI emulation it is necessary to provide your own MSX and/or SVI BIOS ROMs, which must be placed in the ~/.openMSX/share/systemroms directory. §Version¤20.0‰¥AppId±org.openmw.OpenMW¤Name¦OpenMW§SummaryÙ4Reimplementation of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ùshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openmw/OpenMW/fbb90b743fccc80b256740d0a0952edb/icons/128x128/org.openmw.OpenMW.png«Screenshots”Ùlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openmw/OpenMW/fbb90b743fccc80b256740d0a0952edb/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openmw/OpenMW/fbb90b743fccc80b256740d0a0952edb/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openmw/OpenMW/fbb90b743fccc80b256740d0a0952edb/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙlhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openmw/OpenMW/fbb90b743fccc80b256740d0a0952edb/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngªCategories°Game,RolePlaying¯RichDescriptionÚOpenMW is a new engine for 2002's Game of the Year, The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind.

Every manufacturer has their own app, their own brand, their own style. If you want to mix and match devices, you end up with a ton of conflicting, functionally identical apps competing for your background resources. On top of that, these apps are proprietary and Windows-only. Some even require online accounts. What if there was a way to control all of your RGB devices from a single app, on both Windows and Linux, without any nonsense? That is what OpenRGB sets out to achieve. One app to rule them all.

Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the application you are looking for when you are planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are more interested in creating computer-animated movies.

 OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.

 OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is constructive solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion of 2D outlines. As data exchange format for this 2D outlines Autocad DXF files are used. In addition to 2D paths for extrusion it is also possible to read design parameters from DXF files. Besides DXF files OpenSCAD can read and create 3D models in the STL and OFF file formats.§Version§2021.01‰¥AppId¼org.openscopeproject.TrguiNG¤Name§TrguiNG§SummaryÙ*Remote GUI for Transmission torrent daemon­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù‰https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/icons/128x128/org.openscopeproject.TrguiNG.pngÙ‹https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/icons/128x128@2/org.openscopeproject.TrguiNG.png«Screenshots–Ùwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngÙwhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/openscopeproject/TrguiNG/cb56a7f7daf932e9fd58017f789b5834/screenshots/image-6_orig.pngªCategories¯Network,Utility¯RichDescriptionÚxTrguiNG is an alternative UI for controlling transmission torrent daemon running on the same machine or any other host that has exposed transmission rpc endpoint.

Reas and B. Fry and supported by the Processing Foundation.

Included is an integrated development environment that can be used to develop interactive applications using different programming languages but mainly Java, Android, Python, and Javascript.

Known issues:


Python sketches can run but you may have trouble stopping them running. If so, you will have to use your system monitor application of choice (such as htop) to close the sketch, as it will be the only way to stop the sketch, other than closing the IDE itself. This problem also persists outside of Flatpak. See: https://github.com/flathub/org.processing.processingide/issues/5
When trying to open a Python sketch other than an example sketch in the "Examples" dialog, the IDE may crash and close by itself. This problem also persists outside of Flatpak. See: https://github.com/benfry/processing4/issues/793
Python Mode for Processing is currently unmaintained and a new maintainer is currently being sought after. It can still be downloaded and run via the Contribution Manager by going to the mode selection dialog and clicking "Mode Manager -> Modes -> Python Mode for Processing 4 -> Install".

The original inspiration came from the Commodore Amiga version of Deluxe Paint released by Electronic Arts in 1985. Back then, Deluxe Paint helped define the user interface of a paint program with tool bars, menus, and the novel use of left and right mouse buttons for painting and erasing. After pixel art gave way to photo-realism and high-resolution 24 bit color, Deluxe Paint was largely forgotten for artistic work -- left behind in the ever-progressing march of technology.

 Recently, with a resurgence of all things "retro," low-resolution pixel art and limited color palettes have become popular once again. Many tools to deal with this medium are either too complicated or too crude. This project is an attempt to bring back an old but reliable tool and enhance it with some features to help it better coexist in the modern world.§Version¥2.0.1‰¥AppId¯org.pymol.PyMOL¤Name¹Python Molecular Graphics§SummaryÙ&Molecular visualization and raytracing­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùohttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/pymol/PyMOL/9b08e12478f219f2c15caddec187f872/icons/128x128/org.pymol.PyMOL.pngÙqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/pymol/PyMOL/9b08e12478f219f2c15caddec187f872/icons/128x128@2/org.pymol.PyMOL.png«Screenshots“Ùjhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/pymol/PyMOL/9b08e12478f219f2c15caddec187f872/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙjhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/pymol/PyMOL/9b08e12478f219f2c15caddec187f872/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙjhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/pymol/PyMOL/9b08e12478f219f2c15caddec187f872/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories±Science,Chemistry¯RichDescriptionÚPyMOL is one of a few open-source visualization tools available for use in structural biology. The Py portion of the software's name refers to the fact that it extends, and is extensible by the Python programming language. 

 PyMOL has the ability to load, manipulate and visualize molecules from a variety of formats and sources. The program can easily be controlled using a menu-driven GUI, or from a large number of commands and/or scripts. A built-in raytracer is available to generate high-quality images of the views generated in the GL portion of the GUI. 

 PyMOL uses OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) and Freeglut, and can solve Poissonâ€“Boltzmann equations using the Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver (apbs).

Distributed means that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core that stays permanently online -- much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, and similar to (but much more featureful than) so-called BNCs. Re-attaching your client will show your IRC session in the same state as you left it in (plus whatever happened while you were gone), and this even when you re-attach from a different location. In addition, Quassel IRC can be used like a traditional client, with providing both client and core functionality in one binary. This so-called "Monolithic Client" completely hides the distributed nature, so for a purely local installation, Quassel IRC can be setup very easily.

Cross-platform means that Quassel IRC is developed for and tested on LinuxÂ®, WindowsÂ®, and MacOS XÂ®. It should also run on any other platform that is supported by the Qt library. Third-party mobile clients for Android and iOS also exist.

By modern we mean that Quassel IRC will have all the features you'd expect from an IRC client nowadays. It also innovates in many areas. For example, the GUI features a dockable nicklist and topic bar, or you can arrange your channel and query buffers in default or custom views, which are also dockable. This means that you can arrange your GUI as you please. The architecture allows for other innovations, such as on-demand creation of log files in custom formats from the backlog.§Version¦0.14.0‰¥AppId¹org.quetoo.Quetoo.desktop¤Name¦Quetoo§SummaryÙ1A free first person shooter for Mac, PC and Linux­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ùƒhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/quetoo/Quetoo.desktop/d8c0ad59d0c36a688694e04f0b753a90/icons/128x128/org.quetoo.Quetoo.desktop.png«Screenshots“Ùthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/quetoo/Quetoo.desktop/d8c0ad59d0c36a688694e04f0b753a90/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/quetoo/Quetoo.desktop/d8c0ad59d0c36a688694e04f0b753a90/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/quetoo/Quetoo.desktop/d8c0ad59d0c36a688694e04f0b753a90/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories¯Game,ActionGame¯RichDescriptionÙöQuetoo ("Q2") is a free first person shooter for Mac, PC and Linux, with roots steeped in the venerable Quake series.

You will purchase and develop space hardware, recruit and manage astronauts/cosmonauts, and plan and send missions into space. The ultimate goal is to be the first to complete a Moon landing and return your people safely to Earth.

Race Into Space (RIS) is a port to modern operating systems of Buzz Aldrinâ€™s Race Into Space (BARIS), a DOS game originally released in 1993 on floppy disk, and a year later in an expanded CD version. BARIS was developed by Fritz Bronner based on his 1989 board game Liftoff!. Dr. Aldrinâ€™s name and imagery have been dropped because permission to use them was limited to the old DOS game.

RIS is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and includes some improvements over the original gameâ€”which we feel have justified a rewrite of the game manual. Those involved in RIS are volunteer enthusiasts, and we hope you enjoy this simulation.

The software also allows closed-loop interventions via its built-in Python scripting support. It is specifically designed for use in (neuro)scientific in vivo behavior experiments. 

 The modularity of this software allows its use for a wide variety of experiments and it often can be used without any programming skills. Data sources, sinks and processing blocks can be connected graphically with virtual "wires" to form a data flow graph using drag & drop, to represent how data should be acquired, displayed or stored. Syntalos can be expanded with custom Python scripts and custom modules if more flexibility is needed. For all data sources, Syntalos ensures timestamps of incoming data are aligned, so the individual pieces of data can be correlated without additional processig or external synchronization. 

 All data and metadata generated from an experiment run is stored in a well-defined, comprehensive structure, making it easy to compare, pool or share data between experimentalists with different research questions. §Version¥2.0.1‰¥AppId±org.syphon.Syphon¤Name¦Syphon§SummaryÙ)chat with your privacy and freedom intact­ContentRatingÙ@social-chat:intense,social-audio:intense,social-contacts:intense¥IconsÀ«Screenshots‘Ù2https://matrix.org/docs/projects/images/syphon.pngªCategoriesÙ-Chat,InstantMessaging,Network,VideoConference¯RichDescriptionÚ=Syphon aims to be built on the foundations of privacy, branding, and user experience in an effort to pull others away from proprietary chat clients to the matrix protocol.

1Pure instant messaging â€” simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.

 FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

 SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you donâ€™t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

 UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.

 SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffieâ€“Hellman secure key exchange.

 100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published.

 POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

 RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.

 FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

 SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

 PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

 We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Donâ€™t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram â€” join the revolution today.§Version¥5.8.2‰¥AppId½org.telesculptor.TeleSculptor¤Name¬TeleSculptor§SummaryÙ4Photogrammetry designed with a focus on aerial video­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots’Ùnhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kitware/TeleSculptor/master/doc/screenshot/telesculptor_screenshot_linux.pngÙthttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kitware/TeleSculptor/master/doc/screenshot/telesculptor_screenshot_calibration.pngªCategoriesÙP3DGraphics,AudioVideo,DataVisualization,Geoscience,ImageProcessing,Science,Video¯RichDescriptionÚ¨TeleSculptor is a cross-platform desktop application for photogrammetry. It was designed with a focus on aerial video, such as video collected from UAVs, and handles geospatial coordinates and can make use of metadata, if available, from GPS and IMU sensors. However, the software can also work with non-geospatial data and with collections of images instead of metadata. TeleSculptor uses Structure-from-Motion techniques to estimate camera parameters as well as a sparse set of 3D landmarks. It uses Multiview Stereo techniques to estimate dense depth maps on key frame and then fuses those depth maps into a consistent surface mesh which can be colored from the source imagery.§Version¥1.2.0‰¥AppIdºorg.tenacityaudio.Tenacity¤Name¨Tenacity§Summary»Record and edit audio files­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ù…https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/tenacityaudio/Tenacity/dc6a04ac5670e4b72c9967deb2d43130/icons/128x128/org.tenacityaudio.Tenacity.pngÙ‡https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/tenacityaudio/Tenacity/dc6a04ac5670e4b72c9967deb2d43130/icons/128x128@2/org.tenacityaudio.Tenacity.png«Screenshots‘Ùuhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/tenacityaudio/Tenacity/dc6a04ac5670e4b72c9967deb2d43130/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngªCategories°AudioVideo,Audio¯RichDescriptionÚóTenacity is a free, easy-to-use, multi-track audio editor and recorder for Windows, Mac OS X, GNU/Linux and other operating systems.

The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having quite a lot of CPU power at that time. Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games and demos. Hatari is open source software and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

 Hatari supports the emulation of most of the ST and STE hardware, including some special tricks like raster interrupts, border effects and PSG sample sound. A joystick can be emulated with the cursor keys or with a real PC joystick. Hatari also features the possibility to "mount" a directory of the host system as a ST drive, or to use images from an original Atari's hard disk. Hatari is also able to emulate the additional hardware of the TT or Falcon machines, like the Videl video chip or the DSP 56001. However, note that TT and Falcon support are currently still in development and experimental.§Version¥2.5-0‰¥AppIdµorg.tuxpaint.Tuxpaint¤Name©Tux Paint§Summary¾A drawing program for children­ContentRatingÚ5violence-cartoon:none,violence-fantasy:none,violence-realistic:none,violence-bloodshed:none,violence-sexual:none,violence-desecration:none,violence-slavery:none,violence-worship:none,drugs-alcohol:none,drugs-narcotics:none,drugs-tobacco:none,sex-nudity:none,sex-themes:none,sex-homosexuality:none,sex-prostitution:none,sex-adultery:none,sex-appearance:none,language-profanity:none,language-humor:none,language-discrimination:none,social-chat:none,social-info:none,social-audio:none,social-location:none,social-contacts:none,money-purchasing:none,money-gambling:none¥Icons‘Ù{https://dl.flathub.org/media/org/tuxpaint/Tuxpaint/6df8627474b1a97837c4baf17ea3a9d0/icons/128x128/org.tuxpaint.Tuxpaint.png«Screenshots“Ùphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/tuxpaint/Tuxpaint/6df8627474b1a97837c4baf17ea3a9d0/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/tuxpaint/Tuxpaint/6df8627474b1a97837c4baf17ea3a9d0/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙphttps://dl.flathub.org/media/org/tuxpaint/Tuxpaint/6df8627474b1a97837c4baf17ea3a9d0/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategoriesÙ/Education,Art,Graphics,2DGraphics,Game,KidsGame¯RichDescriptionÚ’Tux Paint is a free, award-winning drawing program for children ages 3 to 12.

It can handle general-purpose C/C++ projects as well. Additionally, it is an excellent IDE for people starting their journey with C/C++ programming and looking for an easy-to-use environment with features like a simple build system, code completion, code formatting, and debugger support. 

 U++ is a C++ cross-platform rapid application development framework focused on programmers productivity. It includes a set of libraries (GUI, SQL, Network, etc.), and an integrated development environment. 

 Rapid development is achieved by the smart and aggressive use of C++ rather than through fancy code generators. In this respect, U++ competes with popular scripting languages while preserving C/C++ runtime characteristics. 

 The U++ integrated development environment, TheIDE, introduces modular concepts to C++ programming. It features BLITZ-build technology to speedup C++ rebuilds up to 4 times, Visual designers for U++ libraries, a Topic++ system for documenting code and creating rich text resources for applications (like help and code documentation) and Assist++ - a powerful C++ code analyzer that provides features like code completion, navigation and transformation. 

 TheIDE can work with GCC, Clang, MinGW and Visual C++ and contains a full featured debugger. TheIDE can also be used to develop non-U++ applications. 

 U++ supports following platforms on the production level: Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux & FreeBSD. §Version¨2023.2.1‰¥AppId»org.unitystation.StationHub¤NameªStationHub§SummaryÙ.Launcher for the open-source game Unitystation­ContentRatingÚ!violence-cartoon:intense,violence-bloodshed:intense,violence-desecration:moderate,drugs-alcohol:moderate,drugs-narcotics:moderate,drugs-tobacco:moderate,sex-nudity:mild,language-profanity:intense,language-humor:moderate,language-discrimination:moderate,social-chat:intense,social-info:mild¥IconsÀ«Screenshots•Ù>https://unitystationfile.b-cdn.net/screenshots/stationhub2.pngÙEhttps://unitystationfile.b-cdn.net/screenshots/unitystation-monke.pngÙGhttps://unitystationfile.b-cdn.net/screenshots/unitystation-shuttle.pngÙ=https://unitystationfile.b-cdn.net/screenshots/stationhub.pngÙ;https://unitystationfile.b-cdn.net/screenshots/cargo-ui.jpgªCategories¤Game¯RichDescriptionÚbStationHub is a server browser and installation manager for the open-source game Unitystation.

Our goal is to provide the best Quake II experience possible, we strive to preserve the gameplay as it was back in 1997. Thus we aim mostly for bug fixes, stability and gentle enhancements were appropriate. Yamagi Quake II has a lot of unique features. The most notables ones are: 

 
A modern OpenGL 3.2 renderer, providing a greatly enhanced look and feel. The original OpenGL 1.4 and even the Software renderers are still supported. Both 3D accelerated renderers support anisotropic filtering and multisampling anti aliasing. 
Full support for widescreen displays and arbitrary resolutions. The HUD can be scaled to be readable on high resolutions. 
Support for surround sound, from stereo up to 7.1 channels and even HRTF. The background music can be played from OGG/Vorbis files, a CD drive is no longer necessary. 
A rewritten savegame system. Yamagi Quake II savegames are completely reliable and backward compatible between releases as long as the principle architecture stays the same. 
Highly precise timings. For example, on a flat panel display with a 59.95 hertz refresh rate and vertical synchronisation (VSync) enabled Yamagi Quake II is running at exactly 59.95 frames per second. 
In comparison with the original client over 1.500 bugs were fixed. The Yamagi Quake II client is very well tested and stable. The dedicated server is able to run for weeks without a single restart. Last but not least the code is fully 64 bit clean and highly portable.

It is not just a fancy replacement for your notes app but instead works a bit like a stock management software. The heart of the app is a list with things you always want to have at home. Before you go to the grocery store or whereever you get your stuff from you can go through this list and check for every item how much you have in your storage. The app then generates the shopping list for you which makes it impossible to forget anything.

 Additional features:

 
only once: If you need something like a new knive or some new plates e.g. there is the "only once" option where the item automatically gets deleted as soon as you got it once. 
tags: You can add tags to your items and filter for them. One example workflow could be to tag everything thats in the fridge with a tag called "Fridge" and when you check whats missing you filter for fridge stuff and only open the fridge once. The same can be done while shopping: Tag items for where you can get them and click on the tag when you are there. 
hide temporary: Imagine you have a long shopping list but not enough money with you or some items would be to heavy/big to carry so you decide to get it next time. Now you can click on the Hide temporary button and the item disappears until you restart the app so it does not annoy you.

With ThinLinc you are able to get access to Linux desktops and applications. 

 You can use the ThinLinc Client to connect to an existing ThinLinc Server. You can also set up your own ThinLinc Server. The ThinLinc Server can be downloaded for free from https://www.cendio.com for Linux machines. The ThinLinc Server is free to use for a limited amount of concurrent users per organization. 

 ThinLinc is a software that enables organizations to implement a Linux server-based computing (SBC) infrastructure. By centralizing computing resources in the data center rather than distributing them amongst end-users, IT systems become more efficient, secure, and accessible. End-users' desktops and applications are published from a central location, providing a seamless and familiar environment regardless of which device the user is connecting from, or the user location. Redundancy, inherent in a server-based solution, increases the availability as well. 

 ThinLinc combines the tools and infrastructure required for Linux-based SBC into a mature, stable, and fully-supported package. It consists of both server-side components (session-broker, load-balancer, administration interface, etc.) and end-user components (client software, customization tools, etc.) to provide a complete solution.

Unlike most social networks today, it is not run by a company which has power over the communications between users. The developers of Manyverse can control the source code to build the app and ship new features, but they have no access to user data. The user has complete ownership and responsibility over their data.

The primary goal of this project is to make social networking independent of internet connectivity. Hence the slogan "off the grid". This quality is essential for populations disconnected from the internet (such as in Africa and Latin America) who want to benefit from modern social networking to communicate in their communities.

The secondary goal of this project is to make social networking a neutral public utility for people of all kinds. Neutrality requires this project to be non-commercial, so that profit seeking never interferes with communications between its users, even in the long run. Neutrality also requires that the software developers have no access to and no liability for user content, to create an unbiased environment. Like the internet and the web are decentralized protocols, their inventors are also not liable for content on the web, and thus the web is a more neutral space than proprietary social medias such as Twitter or LinkedIn.

Underneath, Manyverse uses the Secure Scuttlebutt protocol, also known as SSB. This protocol is somewhat like HTTP or RSS, in the sense that it describes how different apps can communicate with each other over the internet or over other networking channels such as Bluetooth. There are other SSB apps which Manyverse can interoperate with, such as Patchwork, Patchbay, Patchfox, and others.§Version­0.2310.9-beta‰¥AppId°se.sjoerd.GIScan¤Name¦GIScan§SummaryÙ1Read and analyze GISAXS data stored in cbf format­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«Screenshots”Ù"http://www.sjoerd.se/giscan_bg.pngÙ$http://www.sjoerd.se/giscan_main.pngÙ$http://www.sjoerd.se/giscan_vert.pngÙ(http://www.sjoerd.se/giscan_settings.pngªCategories±Education,Science¯RichDescriptionÚ¬GIScan is a simple tool to open and analyze data stored in cbf (Crystallographic Binary Format) files. While GIScan is primarily developed with the analyis of GISAXS data in mind, as obtained by the P03 beamline of PETRA III at the DESY Synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany, it should be compatible with any arbitrary cbf data.

GIScan handles raw data directly and doesn't need any a-priori data reduction. It supports features such as background subtraction, line scans along the Qy and Qz axis, detection of the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of diffraction peaks and coordinate conversion from pixels to reciprocal or angular space.

GIScan is mostly developed with the analysis of multilayers in mind but can be used for any arbitrary data stored in cbf format. If a beamline or datatype (be it GISAXS or GISANS) is not supported and you would like to use this tool, please submit an issue on the Github page so this can be arranged.§Version¥1.1.6‰¥AppId°se.sjoerd.Graphs¤Name¦Graphs§Summary¸Plot and manipulate data­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/se/sjoerd/Graphs/05a67e43f9b32b6ca6ec760145ad4c37/icons/128x128/se.sjoerd.Graphs.pngÙshttps://dl.flathub.org/media/se/sjoerd/Graphs/05a67e43f9b32b6ca6ec760145ad4c37/icons/128x128@2/se.sjoerd.Graphs.png«Screenshots•Ùkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/se/sjoerd/Graphs/05a67e43f9b32b6ca6ec760145ad4c37/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/se/sjoerd/Graphs/05a67e43f9b32b6ca6ec760145ad4c37/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/se/sjoerd/Graphs/05a67e43f9b32b6ca6ec760145ad4c37/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/se/sjoerd/Graphs/05a67e43f9b32b6ca6ec760145ad4c37/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngÙkhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/se/sjoerd/Graphs/05a67e43f9b32b6ca6ec760145ad4c37/screenshots/image-5_orig.pngªCategories±Education,Science¯RichDescriptionÚGraphs is a simple, yet powerful tool that allows you to plot and manipulate your data with ease. New data can be imported from a wide variety of file types, or generated by equation. All data can be manipulated using a variety of operations such as the ability to select, cut, translate, multiply, centre and smoothen data, as well as apply any custom transformations on the data.

 Moreover, Graphs supports curve fitting on imported data and offers extensive customisation options for the style of the plots. You can fine-tune and personalise style-sheets to your liking.

 Graphs is an excellent fit for both plotting and data manipulation. The plots created with Graphs can be saved in a variety of formats suitable for sharing and presenting to a wide audience, such as in a scientific publication or presentations. Additionally, the option to save plots as vector images allows for easy editing in software like Inkscape for further refinement. Graphs is written with the GNOME environment in mind, but should be suitable for any other desktop environment as well.

CRU is highly configurable - you can tweak values to find the most natural reading experience. However, it is also highly *opinionated*. It always runs fullscreen because that is the best way to read comics. There is limited GUI because you are expected to learn the mouse or keyboard controls. There is no library browser because your operating system should already have file manager.

CRU is optimized to be as fast and responsive as possible on modern systems without worrying if it will run on legacy hardware. This comes at the cost of memory usage - it is assumed you have at least 4GB of RAM and a modern GPU with 2GB of VRAM. (CRU makes some effort to optimize for battery power but performance comes first.)§Version¥1.0.4‰¥AppId¹uk.co.mangobrain.Infector¤Name¨Infector§SummaryÙ5Play the classic two- to four-player board game Ataxx­ContentRating ¥Icons’Ùƒhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/uk/co/mangobrain.Infector/2ff16c5489d0acae545c8761bfac6acd/icons/128x128/uk.co.mangobrain.Infector.pngÙ…https://dl.flathub.org/media/uk/co/mangobrain.Infector/2ff16c5489d0acae545c8761bfac6acd/icons/128x128@2/uk.co.mangobrain.Infector.png«Screenshots”Ùthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/uk/co/mangobrain.Infector/2ff16c5489d0acae545c8761bfac6acd/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/uk/co/mangobrain.Infector/2ff16c5489d0acae545c8761bfac6acd/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/uk/co/mangobrain.Infector/2ff16c5489d0acae545c8761bfac6acd/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngÙthttps://dl.flathub.org/media/uk/co/mangobrain.Infector/2ff16c5489d0acae545c8761bfac6acd/screenshots/image-4_orig.pngªCategories®Game,BoardGame¯RichDescriptionÙšInfector is a version of the classic board games Ataxx and Hexxagon.

It is hoped that Zint provides a solution which is flexible enough for professional users while at the same time takes care of as much of the processing as possible to allow easy translation from input data to barcode image.

 Zint is currently able to encode data in over 50 barcode symbologies (types of barcode), for each of which it is possible to translate that data from either Unicode (UTF-8) or a raw 8-bit data stream. The image can be rendered as either a Portable Network Graphic (PNG) image, Windows Bitmap (BMP), Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), ZSoft Paintbrush image (PCX), as Encapsulated Post Script (EPS) or as a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG). Many options are available for setting the characteristics of the output image including the size and colour of the image, the amount of error correction used in the symbol and, in the case of raster images, the orientation of the image.§Version¦2.13.0‰¥AppId»uno.platform.uno-calculator¤Name®Uno Calculator§SummaryÙ2Linux port of the Microsoft Windows calculator app­ContentRating ¥Icons‘Ù‡https://dl.flathub.org/media/uno/platform/uno-calculator/da07616d167996e96b44a1a56e270264/icons/128x128/uno.platform.uno-calculator.png«Screenshots“Ùvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/uno/platform/uno-calculator/da07616d167996e96b44a1a56e270264/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/uno/platform/uno-calculator/da07616d167996e96b44a1a56e270264/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngÙvhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/uno/platform/uno-calculator/da07616d167996e96b44a1a56e270264/screenshots/image-3_orig.pngªCategories§Utility¯RichDescriptionÙçThe open-source, Windows Calculator receives a cross-platform makeover from Uno Platform and now runs on Linux in addition to already running on Android, iOS, macOS and Web (WebAssembly) This is a port of the offical Snap version. §Version¥1.2.9‰¥AppId¶us.ihmc.cmap.CmapTools¤Name©CmapTools§Summary½Create and share concept maps­ContentRating·social-contacts:intense¥Icons‘Ù}https://dl.flathub.org/media/us/ihmc/cmap.CmapTools/7a871cdab79c704661fe5c04cdfedf79/icons/128x128/us.ihmc.cmap.CmapTools.png«Screenshots’Ùqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/us/ihmc/cmap.CmapTools/7a871cdab79c704661fe5c04cdfedf79/screenshots/image-1_orig.pngÙqhttps://dl.flathub.org/media/us/ihmc/cmap.CmapTools/7a871cdab79c704661fe5c04cdfedf79/screenshots/image-2_orig.pngªCategories¬Office,Chart¯RichDescriptionÙ°The tool is used across all ages to graphically represent their understanding.

Standalone Client - ArmCord is build as a standalone client and doesn't rely on the original Discord client in any way. 
Various Mods Build In - Enjoy Vencord, Shelter and their many features, or have a more vanilla experience, it's your choice! 
Made for Privacy - ArmCord automatically blocks all of Discord's trackers; even without any client mods you can feel safe and secure! 
Supports Rich Presence - Unlike other clients ArmCord supports rich presence (game activity) out of the box thanks to arRPC. 
Mobile support - ArmCord has a experimental mobile support for phones running Linux such as the PinePhone. While this is still far from ideal solution, we're slowly trying to improve it. 
Much more stable - ArmCord is using a newer build of Electron than the stock Discord app. This means you can have a much more stable and secure experience, along with slightly better performance. 
Cross-platform support - ArmCord was originally created for ARM64 Linux devices, since Discord doesn't support them. We soon decided to support every platform that Electron supports!

Guitarix takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would do: as a mono-signal from your sound card. The input is processed by a main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately and deliver a processed stereo-signal via Jack. You may fill the rack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules including stuff from a simple noise gate to brain-slashing modulation f/x like flanger, phaser or auto-wah.

 It can load two models, which can be *.nam files with the Neural Amp Modeler module, or *.json or .aidax files with the RTNeural module. 

 You can also load just a single model file, in that case the "Blend" control will do nothing. When you've loaded a second model, the "Blend" control will blend between the two models and mix them to simulate your specific tone.

 The "Delay" control could add a small delay to the second model to overcome phasing issues, or to add some color/reverb to the sound. 

 To round up your sound you can load two Impulse Response Files and mix them to your needs. IR-files could be normalised on load, so that they didn't influence the loudness.

Flatpak provides a copy of Vince Liuice's Mojave-style GTK theme in a form that can be used by Flatpak applications. NOTE: this theme is a supplement to the main theme and cannot be enabled on its own. In order to apply this theme to your Flatpak applications, you will need to install the main (non-Flatpak) theme from Vince Liuice's GitHub (linked below) and enable it in GNOME Tweaks. In addition to this Flatpak theme, the following components are currently available:


A Snap version of this theme (for Snap applications)
A cross-platform installer (for non-sandboxed applications)
A Mojave-style circular icon theme
A Firefox theme (in the cross-platform installer)
Themes for both Dash-to-Dock and Plank


Please visit Vince Liuice's GitHub (linked below) for information on the other available components, as well as the editable source code.§Version£0.1‰¥AppIdÙ#org.gtk.Gtk3theme.Numix-Frost-Light¤Name»Numix Frost Light Gtk Theme§Summary»Numix Frost Light Gtk theme­ContentRating ¥IconsÀ«ScreenshotsÀªCategories ¯RichDescriptionÙBA
